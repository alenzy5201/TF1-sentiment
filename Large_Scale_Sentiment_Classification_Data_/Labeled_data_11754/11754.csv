positive,subjective,8 GB RAM is awesome
positive,subjective,Great for watching movies and browsing the web
positive,subjective,Very good product for the price
positive,subjective,"However, I thought I'd mention that it seems to work very well, although some of the games like to crash - not sure if that's the computer or not"
positive,subjective,I was expecting a fast processing no lagging/bugging brand new laptop but i guess not everything is perfect
positive,subjective,Good laptop Idont understand the whole 2 hardrive thing but i like it overall

positive,subjective,"Other than a positivesible hard drive upgrade, it should work fine as is"
positive,subjective,Would recommend going to 8 Gb of Ram
positive,subjective,The touchpad is very useful for Win 8
positive,subjective,I immediately added a software-based hard drive indicator light in the tray
positive,subjective,But the touchpad is designed for Win8 and all the good features reside there
positive,subjective,"Firstly, it is a fast unit, but will benefit greatly from a SSD drive or at least a hybrid (I swapped in a hybrid and it boots quickly and loads applications fast)"
positive,subjective,Not a big fan of the touch pad (noisy to use) but everything else is going good
positive,subjective,"I adjusted the settings to make it less sensitive, turned off tapping (I hate it), and now I like the track pad"
positive,subjective,Even my $8 desktop keyboard has them
positive,subjective,I replaced the HDD with an SSD and it's very fast (faster than an i3 desktop)
positive,subjective,Overall: I would stick to a T-class Lenovo if purchasing that brand ever again (if ever)
positive,subjective,It does not look clunky when open or closed
positive,subjective,It is a plastic build with nice lines
positive,subjective,The T420 has a much better display by comparison and I know that this is not a T-class machine but I expected something even slightly better than what I got
positive,subjective,"In the store, it really did not appear as poor as it really is in daily use so I hook it up to a secondary monitor and use that instead"
positive,subjective,"Those on the Lenovo T420, for example, are sturdy and offer a nice feel when using them"
positive,subjective,All I need to do now is upgrade the screen
positive,subjective,I then installed Windows 8

positive,subjective,"This is the first time ever that I did not purchase and/or setup a Dell machine, and I must say, it was a pleasant change"

positive,subjective,Display - Very sharp and clear
positive,subjective,Pretty slick feature
positive,subjective,The keyboard on this laptop is very well made

positive,subjective,"(I'm familiar with touchscreens and apps, but if someone wasn't, Windows 8"
positive,subjective,"1 took some getting used to, but after messing around with it for a few hours I don't mind it at all (I went from Windows 7 to 8"
positive,subjective,3) I like the back-lit (dimmable) keyboard - typing is smooth and the layout is good
positive,subjective,2) The touchscreen works well and looks great (is vivid and bright
positive,subjective,Battery life seems to be fair to good
positive,subjective,Use of headphones or an external audio device HIGHLY recommended
positive,subjective,The screen size is nice and large and the touch sensors seem to be a bit less sensitive than my VAIO ultrabook
positive,subjective,I recommend using a smaller memory stick if positivesible
positive,subjective,Another feature I used right away was to backup the system recovery partition to a USB drive
positive,subjective,It does make a very nice display for displaying videos to coworkers though
positive,subjective,"The touch display is interesting and being able to rotate the display back greater than 270 degrees allows you to place the computer keyboard down and still be able to interact with the system with touch, gestures and the on-screen keyboard"
positive,subjective,"Six GB of RAM may not be enough for power users, but I saw no issues with day-to-day tasks"
negative,objective,"Battery life isn't the greatest (about 3 1/2 hours on full performance, 4 if the screen is dim)"
negative,objective,"The touchpad does kind of suck (and this is coming from someone who ditched the mouse on my old laptop in favor of solely using the touchpad), but I quit even trying to use it once I got used to the touchscreen, which is awesome"
positive,subjective,The computer is now super fast and a pleasure to use
negative,objective,"uk/blog/technology/fix-for-lenovo-g580-wifi-issues-on-windows-8/  Using the official Lenovo guide to opening the case, I connected the black wire to the WiFi card which had only the white wire connected"

positive,subjective,1 can be annoying at times (rarely) but I have not experienced any difficulties because it was made for touchscreen laptops like this
negative,objective,The keyboard took some time getting used to
negative,objective,My only issue comes from adjusting to the touchpad- I often unintentionally switch screens by swiping the wrong way

positive,subjective,Each of these computers has run reliably and quickly
positive,subjective,We have purchased several at work for our developers and immediately wiped the hard drive to install Linux
positive,subjective,"It responds quickly, even with multiple windows open"
positive,subjective,"Overall, it's a great machine for the price"
positive,subjective,") I've found the best way to deal with it is to not touch the mouse for about 5 seconds, and it returns to normal"
negative,objective,"It is incredibly sensitive, often freezes, and constantly zooms the page in and out"
negative,objective,It began freezing from the first day I had it
negative,objective,The first laptop Amazon sent me had some hardware problem
positive,subjective,"Packaging was great and delivery was on time - ahead of schedule,actually"
positive,subjective,"Fast and user friendly, lots of power and memory"
negative,objective,Would it cost me to re shipped to the US for exchange and return to Jamaica
positive,subjective,Other than that it's a good computer for the price
negative,objective,"My only complaint is the touchpad, which does all kind of annoying stuff if you accidentally touch it the wrong way"
positive,subjective,Modification: One big thing I changed about this laptop was that I replaced my DVD burner with a 2
negative,objective,The arrow key right next to the 0 numpad key can also be annoying
positive,subjective,"It's nice to see 6GB RAM in a laptop at this price range as you can easily chew through RAM when having lots of Chrome tabs, Office, VLC, etc open"
positive,subjective,The i3 is perfectly fine for what I need to do with the laptop which is just to use Office and web browsing
positive,subjective,Specs: For the price (3XX USD) this was hands down the best price vs performance laptop
positive,subjective,"Looks wise, the faux brushed metal look is pretty good"
positive,subjective,Exterior quality: The shell is very thin
positive,subjective,"The sound is pretty good, so I use it as is"
positive,subjective,"This is not a really probable PC, it's a gaming PC that's easy to move from place to place, but no road warrior -- keep this laptop plugged-in"
positive,subjective,"Really good notebook, very thin"
negative,objective,"Only gripe, the battery life is a little short"
positive,subjective,"Amazing keyboard, the wieght isnt a burden to carry in a bag"

negative,objective,- fingerprints are visible on laptop's lid
positive,subjective,8gb ram stock would get 5 stars
positive,subjective,"I tried with 4 and upgraded, big difference booting and loading Web pages"
positive,subjective,Great value for folks that want a small laptop
negative,objective,"So, I thought an external mic would solve my problem but, as I later discovered after a tech call to Lenovo, with combo jacks (The x140E has only one jack for both mic and headset), the combo jack will recognize an ordinary 3"
negative,objective,Not really heard through the speaker playback but if you listen to the recording with a headset you can hear that winning sound
negative,objective,")  Anyhow, I reduced mic boost to zero and the mic volume to 40% but it didn't help much"
negative,objective,There is a background noise in the audio  that is very annoying
positive,subjective,"It's fairly decent in my opinion as onboard webcams go, picture wise that is"
positive,subjective,It does allow for low light recording which is good for me since I record mostly at night
positive,subjective,I watched an HD movie last night on the Lenovo and it was equally as good
positive,subjective,"Once again, I have a Toshiba Thrive tablet and it has a great HD screen so that was my standard"
positive,subjective,Very light on the bass and thin sound through the speakers
positive,subjective,But forget about thinking that it having Dolby means it's gonna sound good with music
positive,subjective,"Sound through the speakers is loud as laptops go so, if listening to the spoken word, it will do fairly well"
positive,subjective,And it's not cramped at all as I expected being a small laptop
positive,subjective,As good as an old Dell laptop I had which was my standard for a laptop keyboard
positive,subjective,I really like the keyboard
positive,subjective,"So, if you're expecting this thing to perform like a ""work horse"" that can run a few programs at a time, it will definitely depend on which programs and the resources they require"
positive,subjective,I ran the battery of tests (some tests take hours so be aware of that) and I passed them all
negative,objective,"I actually disabled Windows Update for now and, so far, no choke ups"
negative,objective,"24/7 tech support but I just discovered, after a call about bluetooth (I could not access the software so I could not pair my new headset) that their tech support is only for hardware issues and that Tech support for software issues is a paid service"
negative,objective,"If you do the Operating System Restore process using the Lenovo Software, DO NOT USE AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE THAT ALREADY HAS DATA ON IT"
positive,subjective,I'll try to positivet an update once I start using it daily
positive,subjective,"Based on the price, specs, and shipping, I think this was possibly the best deal on a basic college friendly laptop"
positive,subjective,"I still strongly prefer Mac's OS, but needed something with Windows for work purpositivees"
negative,objective,The worst part of the whole experience is all the bloatware that comes with the laptop and the Windows OS
positive,subjective,"The screen is not terribly impressive, but it's good enough for doing what I need to do with it"
positive,subjective,"The size is perfect too - enough to feel sturdy, but still fits easily into a large purse or work bag"
positive,subjective,"DO NOT purchase this laptop if you're looking for a computer that can store lots of stuff, run multiple applications, and do work that requires fast processing"
positive,subjective,"It was a great price (snagged it for $280), has a fantastic battery life, the keyboard is comfortable to use, and the speed is respectable"
positive,subjective,"If you are looking at this laptop, before buying consider what it is that you will use it for"
positive,subjective,"Originally, I planned to get a Mac Air, but this one was several times cheaper, and I could upgrade it and do more"
positive,subjective,Better than average battery life
positive,subjective,I added a Kingston 4GB memory stick to up it to 8GB for future use but the memory it came with was fine
positive,subjective,Since I'm using it as a work computer I have to add a monitor to it but that's okay
positive,subjective,For under $300 (before tax mind you) this is an outstanding little computer and with an 11
positive,subjective,Great little labtop really like it needs memory upgrade
negative,objective,"*Battery life leaves more to be desired, but then again, it's the skinniest little rod lodged in the back of the thing"
positive,subjective,They are sturdy now
negative,objective,"It lasts about 30sec every 30-45min, but it's so bad that I bought a wireless mouse to avoid it"
positive,subjective,"Good quality resolution webcam, too, although I never use it"
positive,subjective,"The colors are vivid (including the yellows), and for a 15"
positive,subjective,No wonder it's rumored that Lenovo's keyboards are the best in the business
positive,subjective,"The material seems thick and sturdy, much like Vaio's magnesium laptop material"
positive,subjective,"*Surprisingly durable, expensive feeling plastic"
positive,subjective,*Way more power than I expected
positive,subjective,"Great deal and fast shipping, too"
negative,objective,"The screen color saturation, shadows, projected light, and materials rendering are basically crap, but it does render them"
negative,objective,In SL I set the Firestorm viewer to Ultra and oddly enough it performs without significant lag even with a Wifi connection
positive,subjective,"I was attracted to this machine for its price, the i3 processor, Bluetooth, and 6GB RAM"
positive,subjective,"But I didn't want to waste money on a machine I couldn't actually do work on, so I opted for something just a bit better"
positive,subjective,"I'll have a good desktop where I'm going, but I needed something to transport my essential files and a few special apps, so I was really looking in the under-$300 range"
positive,subjective,"Very thin with DVD, great user interface, stylish and durable brushed metal case/look, lots of ports at a fantastic price"
positive,subjective,Performance/speed meets her expectations
positive,subjective,"She uses it for school, watching movies etc"
positive,subjective,The power cable for it is a nice design it has an odd connection into the unit which looks like it would be difficult to break or accidentally bend ( I had this happen with a Toshiba Satellite and it was difficult to use comfortably afterwards )
positive,subjective,In terms of the hardware compatibility with the Linux kernel I can't say I didn't test it extensively
positive,subjective,So if you intend to boot GNU then you shouldn't have much of an issue after disabling Secure Boot
positive,subjective,This laptop comes very close even though it has a DVD drive
positive,subjective,I think if that is something you are looking for in a laptop you will be pleased with this
positive,subjective,I like a laptop to sit on my lap comfortably and not to take up a huge amount of space because that is not a comforting experience for me
negative,objective,The i key on it was loose then came completely off
negative,objective,The main issue is that is has no ethernet port
negative,objective,"The only other issue is the touch pad, but it's more of a sensitivity thing and learning Windows 8 gestures than the laptop itself"
negative,objective,"It's glossy, which isn't too big a deal, but you can see the pixel grid which is to me"
positive,subjective,It's good for $350
positive,subjective,"Over all it's a good laptop, especially for the price"
positive,subjective,"no regrets so far buying this item,also kudos to amazon for fast shipping that was free"
negative,objective,"BUT: I really hate using the mouse buttons, it could just be that they look like they were sunken down a little more but I don't know"
positive,subjective,"OVERALL: I like this laptop; It looks spectacular, it feels nice, it's light and thin, very very useful and nice"
positive,subjective,"Other than that it runs very well, it boots pretty fast and handles apps and Windows 8"
positive,subjective,Good USB transfer speeds
positive,subjective,Good performance for the money
positive,subjective,Performance is pretty good as long as you're willing to be patient once in a while for the inevitable slowdown
positive,subjective,"SD card slot is a nice touch, especially for those wanting fast access to photos and video"
negative,objective,"This laptop's biggest weakness is it's slow 5400rpm platter drive, which results in the entire system grinding to a halt during heavy file transfers to and from the hard disk"
positive,subjective,"I wanted this laptop to be mostly affordable, but also be able to handle Adobe Lightroom so that I can do photography work on the go"
positive,subjective,I ordered the G50 Core i3 for the $350 deal going on a few weeks ago

negative,objective,"However, they are not lit as some will want a lit keyboard for a number of reasons"
positive,subjective,"After using this computer for a few months, I would say this is a very well designed laptop which delivers solid value with genuine Intel chip, plenty of RAM for most users at 6GB and a decent 500GB HDD"
negative,objective,"The screen display seem a bit faded in terms of contrast, but since I am not familiar with Windows 8"
negative,objective,I've fixed problems via troubleshooting and have updated drivers with only limited success
negative,objective,"However I've spent hours trying to solve somewhat intermittent, but frequent problems with the wireless connection"
negative,objective,I have owned several brands of laptop PC's and this is the WORST costumer service
negative,objective,"I argued with the guy for ten minutes, and eventually spoke to a supervisor who told me that there was now NO warranty any more since 30 days had passed"
negative,objective,There is no update for it yet
negative,objective,"However, another issue I have had is that the driver for the touch screen often comes up with conflicts yielding the touchscreen inoperable"
negative,objective,Update: Asus indeed did not offer ANY support for the issue
negative,objective,they wanted a $100 to fix the problem
negative,objective,"However, there are still glitches in the software that make the product HIGHLY frustrating"
positive,subjective,The Ultrabook boots fast and works wonderfully with an integrated touchscreen
positive,subjective,Windows 8 seems fun and sleek
negative,objective,"Of course, with my luck, the touch screen was and still is unresponsive"
negative,objective,"Upon reboot, the touch screen simply didn't function"
negative,objective,"Suddenly, with my hands away from the device, multiple points began to be ""pressed"" on the screen, and my Start Screen UI started to shake uncontrollably, as if a bunch of fingers were simultaneously tapping different parts of the screen"
negative,objective,The screen quality has nothing special and reflects light easily
negative,objective,"This laptop is not really fast for a brand new one, and sometimes the screen freezes without any reason"
negative,objective,Sometimes the touchpad mouse stop working and I have to restart the pc

negative,objective,"The touchpad is constantly in the way when typing, the cursor is constantly jumping around"
negative,objective,"The apps that can be opened from the start page are very limited in what they can do, it's better to just go to the desktop and work from there"
negative,objective,Unfortunately Windows 8 is short on functionality
negative,objective,The touch screen function is something I personally never use and simply creates more confusion and frustration
negative,objective,The specs of the hardware also don't seem capable so far to smoothly run the operating systems
negative,objective,only to find out that the touch screen keyboard DOES NOT WORK
negative,objective,The screen is somewhat saturated
negative,objective,It is just unacceptable for this laptop to be painfully slow
negative,objective,I was very disappointed by its performance - this laptop is way too slow
negative,objective,The wireless was spotty and there was significant lag when opening programs
negative,objective,Out of the box this computers performance was poor
positive,subjective,- seems like it's sturdy and well built
negative,objective,- The touchpad's buttons are part of the touchpad - so every time I want to click on something the mouse pointer moves and it's annoying
negative,objective,- the wireless stops working every few hours for a few minutes - and it sometimes doesn't work well after the computer wakes up from sleep mode
negative,objective,"This computer is suppositiveed to have the OS installed on the 500gb HDD, I received it with the OS on the 24gb SSD"
negative,objective,If you look at other reviews of this laptop you can see that a few other people are experiencing the same unexpected shut downs
negative,objective,I can't use it for presentations because I am afraid of it shutting down in front of an audience
negative,objective,There are many instances in which I have lost my work because the computer had unexpectedly shut off (happens at least once every 2-3 days)

positive,subjective,Will update as I think of more helpful info
negative,objective,"I broke one USB port trying to insert a flash drive, so my advice would be to handle it gently"

negative,objective,inadequate CPU chip with video
negative,objective,touch screen not always responsive
negative,objective,crashed a couple of times
positive,subjective,touch screen concept is nice
negative,objective,because it really does not work with HD resolution
negative,objective,I find the HDMI port on this computer very misleading
negative,objective,the HDTV's resolution is reduced
negative,objective,"was not high enough to connect to a HDTV, unless perhaps"
negative,objective,the error message I got was that the resolution was not high enough
negative,objective,"it has an HDMI port, but I wasn't able to use it to display on my 720P HDTV,"
negative,objective,internet connection drops every ten minutes
positive,subjective,"All that said, the rest of the computer seems to work very well and the flippable design is something that I really wanted for my father so he could use tablet or laptop so that's why I didn't return it"
negative,objective,The first thing you need to know is that the wireless card on this computer is absolute junk
negative,objective,"I was concerned about reviews of wireless connection issues but, since these were in the minority, I decided to give this computer a try anyway"
negative,objective,"This was added to by the location of the power button on the left side at the front, meaning it is very easy to switch off by mistake"
positive,subjective,"I was excited to get this laptop as it was my first new one in a long time, the touchscreen is very nice to use but the laptop is let down by the windows 8"
negative,objective,"However, after 3 weeks this $750 computer has stopped charging"

negative,objective,Even though I have international warranty the replacement will take almost a month
negative,objective,I brought to India and the service center response are very slow and they are saying that there will be some issue in mother board

negative,objective,It showed every fingerprint
positive,subjective,I bought an HP &amp; their lit keys are great
negative,objective,It had silver keys with the shape of the letters cut out which made the keys unreadable during the day
negative,objective,The design for the lit keys was flawed
negative,objective,"The computer box was placed inside of a larger box (as expected), but with very little added protection (the computer was literally rattling around in the larger box)"
negative,objective,"It had intermittent operating problems (2 navigation arrows on screen at same time, intermittently scrolled thru various windows for no reasons, shaking screen displays, etc"
positive,subjective,First - I'm a big fan of ASUS (and have another ASUS laptop that I'm using to write this review)
negative,objective,Keyboard not backlit like advertised
negative,objective,"He bumped it off the nightstand, and it fell 18&#34; to the ground, and the touch screen cracked"
negative,objective,Basically its a Windows OS that is dedicated to trying to get you to buy apps for everything
negative,objective,"Regardless of it's inability to turn on, if you can get it working, it's ok"
negative,objective,"Even when it's put to sleep and shut, the battery quickly drains even with ZERO use"
negative,objective,"You can see where the pressure point is right on one of the clamps for the keyboard portion, but ASUS refuses to cover the repair under a defect warranty"
negative,objective,The hinge was so tight a crack formed from bottom to the top of the device
negative,objective,The MOST concerning issue I've had is when I closed the lid
negative,objective,"While that was an accident, and they do happen, I've kept laptops in that backpack for years and never had that issue"
negative,objective,"I do not know what causes this issue, but it happens to both of our units"
positive,subjective,"After that, you can install the update manually and it works fine"
negative,objective,"For some reason, the automated updates will kill features like wifi constantly"
negative,objective,The home button only works half of the time
negative,objective,also by now the return window has closed with Amazon and i am pretty disappointed with this device
negative,objective,i did buy the ever last case to help protect and keep the 2 devices together but to no avail
negative,objective,"Second, the connection from the tablet to keyboard keeps disengaging enough where i cannot use the keyboard and i have to re attach them ever couple of minutes"
negative,objective,Multitasking is an issue especially as newer updates are put into place from Microsoft
negative,objective,"I have had this Asus for about 5 months now, what i am finding is that this processor doesn't not have the ability to accommodate the power to run windows 8 effectively"
negative,objective,READ THIS: If you buy this product or any ASUS product MAKE SURE YOU BUY A 4 year 100% guarantee warranty
negative,objective,its just not useable to record or take pictures
negative,objective,In this day and age what company would produce a laptop or tablet that doesn't have a forward faceing camera
negative,objective,but then again no keyboard is unacceptable
negative,objective,The onscreen keyboard works but I cant type a whole paper without going crazy using that
negative,objective,"Whenever I try to type on it, I hear computer error noises and no letters"
negative,objective,Now more recently the keyboard it's self has stopped working all together
negative,objective,You can watch maybe 1 1/2 shows online before it goes dead
negative,objective,"The key board I feel is the root of the problem, and the problem in of its self"
positive,subjective,they work and are really cool when I get to use them
positive,subjective,Let me clarify that the system and accessories pertaining to the apps are great
negative,objective,This will be my last Asus
negative,objective,And of course I'm afraid to use the Power button or to install any purchased software that will disappear if I need to send it back again
negative,objective,"So, between shipping costs for the repair and a new MS Office download I'm out of pocket by about 40% of the cost of the computer"
negative,objective,"No, they didn't sell software"
negative,objective,"Well, then, could they give me the Product Key of another MS Office license, which they presumably had since that info is packaged with each new computer"
negative,objective,And I'd lost the Product Key to reinstall Windows
negative,objective,No idea why they needed to reinstall the OS when they fixed a switch but whatever
negative,objective,"Then the Power button jammed, in the Off position, of course"
positive,subjective,I liked this computer- for the first 3 weeks
negative,objective,I will look to return it or resell it (probably at a loss)
negative,objective,"Both of these makes it completely useless for me, since I primarily bought it as a way to take some kind of personal computer with me on business trips"
negative,objective,"Also, if you use it while charging, it sometimes uses more power than it takes in"
negative,objective,If i charge this before my trip and then open it up the next morning (without having turned it on) it's already completely drained
negative,objective,"The biggest problems, however, have to do with the battery power"
negative,objective,"For something so small, it's actually pretty clunky"
negative,objective,Battery depleted way too soon
negative,objective,it is embarrassing to say the least
negative,objective,the battery is constantly dies even when it is even plugged to wall socket
negative,objective,I returned the item within days for a refund instead of requesting a replacement because i didn't want to waste more time and money and perhaps receive another defective tablet
negative,objective,I gave the item two stars because it was effectively unusable out of the box
negative,objective,The charger's USB is poorly made
negative,objective,The tablets USB is wobbly
negative,objective,The item failed to take a charge and the battery slowly ran down
positive,subjective,Opened the packaging and found everything packaged nicely
negative,objective,"If you are ready to commit $350+ to a machine and treat it like glass even with a case then go for it, otherwise find another product"
negative,objective,I had only taken the tablet from class to home and somehow the screen shattered
negative,objective,That was until I opened my backpack and case to find the screen shattered
negative,objective,"If I wanted to use an external mouse, I would have had to use the one USB port available, meaning I couldn't utilize a USB drive to store or transfer files"
negative,objective,"The mouse was all over the place when I tried to type, but I suppose that is due to the nature of a tablet-size keyboard and necessary placement"
negative,objective,"I had to hold down the power button, and when that didn't work, I had to just close it and leave it alone to try again later"
negative,objective,It didn't always power down when told
negative,objective,"When I'd used the device for a couple of days, I discovered that the Windows interface was not worth the extra hard drive space"
negative,objective,"The Windows OS and Office Suite in conjunction with the native apps consumed roughly 30GB, as I expected from reading previous reviews, making me glad I chose the 64GB unit"
negative,objective,"It wasn't going to fall apart in my hands, but I've had plenty of Asus products and handled other tablets, and never has one felt like I'd have to treat it as gently as this one"
negative,objective,"Once inserted, the microSD card was pushed behind the edge of the slot, and I had a heck of a time getting it out"
negative,objective,"The touchpad was not attached properly, and had a tendency to slide off center, causing problems with sustained use"
negative,objective,"Unfortunately, this Transformer model did not live up to what I've come to expect from Asus"
negative,objective,"I can't click, cannot navigate, is completely crooked"
negative,objective,"I just opened my second tablet, the mouse pad is jacked up"
negative,objective,"Some software for Windows doesn't expect a missing keyboard; not Asus' fault, just an inconvenience"
negative,objective,Even when asleep it won't charge
negative,objective,Sometimes other touches don't well either
negative,objective,Trying to &#34;touch&#34; anything around the perimeter rarely works until it's been tapped a whole bunch of times
negative,objective,Unfortunately this tablet/laptop does not have the ability to use Outlook
negative,objective,i wasn;t expecting a rocket ship but i expected more based  on the reviews
negative,objective,even on the  web it lags
negative,objective,needs more memory to run 8
negative,objective,My netbook from 3yrs ago is faster than this
negative,objective,I would not have purchased it at all if I would have realized that games like Words with Friends were not available as apps
negative,objective,"The touch and feel of the keyboard was terrible, takes forever to scroll down to load up Emails"
negative,objective,I have to restart the computer for it to appear under Devices
negative,objective,3)  Often the D drive &#34;disappears&#34;
negative,objective,I always need to shut the computer down to turn the camera off
negative,objective,I can not find a key that turns it off
negative,objective,2)  Sometimes the camera turns itself on
negative,objective,It is difficult to complete a single sentence correctly
negative,objective,"1) when I am typing on the key board the software jumps around to other parts of the text, usually to where the cursor is"
negative,objective,I like the tablet but the operating system is CRAP
negative,objective,If they want to be really innovative they should make the keyboard and back panel solar powered
negative,objective,"It said that the battery life lasts somewhere between 12-14hrs, however the maximum life I got out of it since the beginning was the average 4-5hrs"
negative,objective,"I've had this since mid-September and it no longer charges, I believe the charger port is loose :(  What's frustrating is just how short the cord is for this device, and the placement of it really isn't the most friendly place"
negative,objective,"If you really, really want to buy one, get the warranty because you will probably need it within a month or two"
negative,objective,The bottom line is that I would not recommend the Asus Transformer book for school
negative,objective,"While it costs around $15 to replace each charger, the Asus warranty  service is so bad that I just paid for it myself"
negative,objective,"In addition, one of the chargers broke and the second one is barely working"
negative,objective,"Last week, the second Asus came home with a cracked screen"
negative,objective,"While it is lighter and powerful enough to use at school, one of the screens was cracked the second week of school"
negative,objective,It is so loose and every time that i try to use i have problems
negative,objective,But the keyboard  (mostly the touch pad) came with a problem
negative,objective,Other people reporting battery drain from dock in sleep mode:
negative,objective,"Other folks having power failure, discussing things they've tried and helping eachother try and find a solution, but none is really ever found:"
positive,subjective,This would be a fantastic product for the price
negative,objective,"I don't know if this product was made by a new department or what happened here, but with soo many people having the same fatal issue, they really dropped the ball"
positive,subjective,"I really think they tried, and this company has a fantastic reputation for quality"
negative,objective,"It wasn't until I started taking it to work and to school that I noticed the battery only lasted about 45 minutes, and most of those 45 were spent rebooting from unexpected shutoffs"
negative,objective,It should be a red flag when you can get used models of a product just a year old for almost nothing
positive,subjective,The lucky ones get their money back
negative,objective,"Updated to the latest version of everything, and this is still an issue for my device"
negative,objective,"Not enough to stop selling useless garbage, but enough to release some software updates every few months, so there's that"
positive,subjective,I've done all the updates available
positive,subjective,"So I thought, oh I'll just make sure and update it"
negative,objective,"Before I bought this device I knew that, and noticed tons of people in this comments section said they had this issue before updating"
positive,subjective,"Physically good too, their motherboards have been praised and the whole company kind of came out of no where and is one of the top contenders"
positive,subjective,Asus is known for making good quality products
positive,subjective,This I found from various sleep testing and browsing forums online
positive,subjective,"Also, anything that is plugged into drains the battery even while it's in sleep mode"
positive,subjective,"If that sounds like a smart buy to you, go ahead and buy it"
positive,subjective,"It runs great, speeds are nice, great connectivity, bright screen, everything you could want from a mid level laptop really"
negative,objective,"So if you need to type anything, I hope you're good with your thumbs"
negative,objective,"Power failure also happens if it isn't plugged in and you are using the keyboard hard drive dock it came with, since that is also bus powered"
negative,objective,So you can't plug anything into that usb port that's so heavily advertised
negative,objective,The guys at the electronics store got a kick out of the guy with a computer that you couldn't plug anything into
negative,objective,Just shuts off like you cut the power
negative,objective,It has to be plugged into power at all times because it can't manage power or battery life at all
positive,subjective,And it's crazy cheap for what you're getting
positive,subjective,The screen size is perfect and keyboard feels natural
positive,subjective,"It doesn't look bad at all, and the touchscreen is accurate and responsive"
negative,objective,It's dual capactity (as both laptop and tablet) impairs functionality as on more than one occassion the monitor didn't respond to the keypad upon reattaching it
negative,objective,"frequent charges because there is no hibernation mode), balanced awkwardly so that it really was only useable on the"
negative,objective,"intermittently) it had poor battery life (nowhere near the 10 hours advertised), took forever to charge (despite requiring"
negative,objective,Besides being defective (the computer started
negative,objective,"listen the one i received does not charge or rather it does not turn on, I would like the product if i could use it but i cannot"
negative,objective,"From the little bit I did use it, I like the versatility of the 2-in-1 and the clarity of the images"
negative,objective,After one month I have barely been able to use the Transformer Book because it was either in need of repair or I cannot charge it
negative,objective,In the past 4 weeks I have made 10 contacts to ASUS support and I am still waiting for my power cord to be returned
negative,objective,"The service center made repairs, but did not return my AC adapter and power cord"
negative,objective,The hard drive crashed and I had to return the product to ASUS on the second day
negative,objective,Record of waiting time for me has been greater than 20 minutes
negative,objective,"When there are updates (and they are more frequent than anybody expects) the machines goes out of commission and you have to patiently wait for updates to go from 1% completed to 100% completed, staring at a blue screen"
negative,objective,"Many a time, I had place the tablet on the floor to recharge it"
negative,objective,At times I had to press the &#34;on&#34; button more than 10 times to convince the machine to go on
negative,objective,"When you press the &#34;on&#34; button, the tablet will (or will not) go on"
negative,objective,The machine has to be OFF completely
negative,objective,Hibernation mode (closing the tablet unto the keyboard) does not allow for recharging either
negative,objective,"If it is not off, the little amber indicator signals that the machine is charging but in reality there is no recharging taking place unless the machine is completely off"
negative,objective,"If it is not off, the battery will not recharge"
negative,objective,"In order to recharge the battery, the machine has to be off"
negative,objective,"When not attached to the keyboard, the tablet by itself is very heavy for its size"
negative,objective,"Design is terrible: It is top heavy so if the tablet is attached to the keyboard and you are not careful, you may have an accident when it tilts back and lands on whatever surface is behind the screen (so far I have been lucky and I have been able to catch it before the somersault takes place)"
negative,objective,"The main screen was loaded with applications I would never use, and I could not find a way to move my favorite apps to the main screen"
negative,objective,I could not get used to the Windows operating system
negative,objective,"While attached to the keyboard the typing should default to the keyboard, but every time I needed to type something, the virtual keyboard popped up"
negative,objective,"As soon as I got home the WiFi was enabled again, but I decided I really could not live with the product and I returned it"
negative,objective,"Customer service was available only by Internet, so there was no one I could call for help, and the product was useless"
negative,objective,After the first week the WiFi was disabled and nothing I did would enable it again
negative,objective,I am an Apple who mistakenly thought I could use this Asus product
positive,subjective,"It was easy to access and it had great graphics and lighting, and loved how easy it was to detach the keyboard"
negative,objective,"I bought this to replace my wife's previous Acer Aspire One with an Ariel Atom processor, and she also uses an Acer Aspire Timeline with a Celeron processor, and this machine simply isn't that big of an improvement"
negative,objective,"Again, this is isolated to only this PC, as we have other PC's that work fine (including two that are 8 years old with Celeron and Pentium processors) and are on a 75MB/s FIOS connection using a wireless N network"
negative,objective,Compare this to any of our other computers on the network and there are zero issues
negative,objective,When we try to upload large videos to YouTube (2GB) it pretty much stops and does not work
negative,objective,The screen cannot be tilted back far enough for a comfortable viewing angle while using this on your lap
negative,objective,"When I'm using it as a laptop and I go away and come back and wake it up, it often gives me some error message and has to restart my computer"
negative,objective,The tablet/screen is laying on the bed and the keyboard is propped up on my legs
negative,objective,"To type this right now, I am sitting on a bed sitting cross-legged"
negative,objective,Be warned that if you're working on something while it's attached to the keyboard - anything you save to the hard drive can't be accessed from just the tablet
positive,subjective,"12-20-14, I moved my laptop to another office that uses different router mode and there is no problem with the internet connection"
positive,subjective,I will update if there's any progress
negative,objective,The screen blanked out 6 days after the purchased date and has not come back on since then
negative,objective,"Screen: If you try to use this in tablet mode, it is difficult to see the entire screen because viewing from angles doesn't work very well"
negative,objective,If you carry the laptop by that edge you can feel the piece of plastic easily bending
negative,objective,Flip Function: The screen is attached to machine via a flimsy plastic piece
negative,objective,The told me to download the driver from their site and install it which I did
negative,objective,This laptop wigs out a lot and I have to shut it down and restart it
negative,objective,"So the bottom line is if you can are willing to sacrifice slow download speeds for good performance, then go for it"
negative,objective,"Nothing lags or stutters and everything runs pretty smoothly, but I will probably have to either end up returning the laptop (due to the download speed) or try to get Best Buy or someone else to recommend a fix to it"
positive,subjective,"After months of browsing and comparing laptops, I decided to go with this one despite some of the negative reviews I read about wi-fi problems"
positive,subjective,"edit - I meant to submit this review for the i7 variant of this laptop, not the i5"
positive,subjective,"The processor and RAM on this thing are pretty sweet, and I liked using the desktop and Metro interfaces on it"
negative,objective,The screen falls back when you try to touch it
negative,objective,"I wasn't expecting an IPS display out of this, but this is just unusable"
positive,subjective,An SSD or 7200 RPM HDD would have been nice
negative,objective,5400 RPM seems to be the standard
negative,objective,"Instead, Amazon should simply disclose that the buyer pays for return shipping"
negative,objective,My experience with the outsourced customer service today was awful
negative,objective,Getting reimbursed means documenting your insured shipping charges and supplying them to Amazon
negative,objective,The first rep offered a pre-paid shipping label
negative,objective,"After 40 minutes on the phone with two different outsourced customer service reps, I was ready to stick a fork in my leg"
negative,objective,Disabling the invasive anti-virus made no difference
negative,objective,The huge issue is the back lit kybd is white light and it has white keys it it very hard to see the keys in a well lite sunny room
negative,objective,When received it had a small quarter size dent on the top
negative,objective,I can't even send a message about this order to Amazon (other than this comment)
negative,objective,Next morning I contacted Asus and was told that the subwoofer was not covered  under the warranty for physical damage
negative,objective,My other friends who have purchased Asus laptops have problems of all sorts as well that cannot be easily fixed
negative,objective,"The problem is a day after I got it, if I adjusted the screen positiveition, the screen cuts off"
positive,subjective,"But overall, the laptop is very nice and has more than sufficient power and memory for heavy computation and graphics from MATLAB and COMSOL applications"
positive,subjective,6&#34; laptops but the design is nice and fresh
positive,subjective,"But the laptop design is gorgeous, a lil heavier than regular 15"
positive,subjective,"The backlit keyboard was fine, I'm not picky about cosmetics so if the keyboard backlight was bleeding, I wouldn't know"
negative,objective,They paid for return shipping
negative,objective,1 product key is not provided with this laptop or its packaging
negative,objective,Warning: If you plan to keep the original hard drive then the performance of this laptop will be quite terrible
negative,objective,"Caps lock light is on the front, very difficult to see when you are typing"
negative,objective,"I installed original microsoft office, and when I work with excel once in a while the page I'm on becomes motionless and I have to close the program and open it again to keep on working"
negative,objective,All in all a great laptop but such a big screen problem right out of the box is definitely an issue
negative,objective,"Sometimes while closing my laptop to put it to sleep, the screen will fuzz over completely and get stuck in a weird glitchy pattern"
positive,subjective,"I am always very careful with my laptops, doubly so with this expensive one (none of the models I have received have ever even left my house/desk area), so I am completely baffled why they keep breaking"
negative,objective,"It will not respond to having headphones plugged in all the way, only halfway, which leads me to believe it is either lose or one of the prongs has been bent"
negative,objective,"the ""o"" key would not respond, it was completely dead"
negative,objective,2nd Edit: First replacement shipped to me from amazon had faulty keyboard
negative,objective,Now currently shifted to Y50 which has a pathetic Screen
positive,subjective,Its a touch screen and its display was too awesome
positive,subjective,It was a gorgeous laptop which played any game i thrown at it
positive,subjective,I waited till the replacement arrived so i can transfer the data from one Laptop to another
negative,objective,The Touch screen was not working for the first laptop I ordered
positive,subjective,It is a Good Gaming Laptop considering the price of it
positive,subjective,"Ideally, this computer would be awesome (aside from the 5400 rpm mechanical hard drive ASUS decided to use for this model)"
negative,objective,For the hardware this was abysmally slow
negative,objective,"Even after striping offf the extras, the anti-virus, and unnecessary programs, this machine is still slow"
negative,objective,so that they ca keep it for two weeks (skipped &#34;n&#34;) to fix the faulty keyboard
negative,objective,So I contacted tech support (obviously in India) and he took control of my computer (which I HATEHATEHATE but I let him do it) and he tried installing a new driveer as well (another &#34;e&#34; there)
positive,subjective,"This keyboard is fine for students or others on aa budget, and basically works fine, is sturdy enough if you're careful with it at all, is quiet, and so on"
negative,objective,Have to re-type many letters for them to appear
negative,objective,They recommended I get an additional 4G ram
negative,objective,Now at least it will restart in less than 5 minutes but the dual instead of the quad Intel processor does make a difference
negative,objective,1 or at least that was the case a few months ago
negative,objective,Just found out it is the Nitro program pre-loaded to block the download
negative,objective,I am unable to download Adobe Flash
negative,objective,"this arrived quickly, but the windows operating system was defected"
negative,objective,I'm not sure if the speakers on my laptop are damaged or if they work properly and are just that poor of a quality
negative,objective,it should be down right easy and fun to use right out of the box
positive,subjective,odly some things are sharp and nice
negative,objective,the wifi seems to be sketchy UNTIL it contacts
positive,subjective,Micro SD is nice
positive,subjective,I have finally started taking a separate keyboard so I can work productively with this laptop
negative,objective,Cool feature with the finger scanner though
negative,objective,"Numerous times I have tried to copy and paste, only to realize I once again used the function key because that's where my fingers naturally go"
negative,objective,I haven't found a solution to fix this
negative,objective,The biggest problem is there is a lot of noise (intermittent clicking) from the hard drive
positive,subjective,great build quility and normal keys not a chinese arrangement
negative,objective,Freezing up and had to reboot 20 times in two days
negative,objective,I'd still rate the laptop 4 out of 5 stars considering how inexpensive it was but the trackpad gets 0 stars and so the average is 2
negative,objective,"It doesn't have trackpad buttons to use as you are expected to somehow use the springboard instead (again, not like a macbook pro where the touchpad is AMAZING)"
positive,subjective,I knew it was going to be a cheaper laptop because I didn't spend much money on it
positive,subjective,You can seriously get a way better computer at the price that this computer is
negative,objective,I still had to buy a WiFI adapter - the WiFi on the computer kept on disconnecting and connecting
negative,objective,"I've researched a couple of reviews for this laptop, and found a couple of reviews that state that the WiFi is horrible"
negative,objective,"And it's not easy to sync it with an iPhone (or at least, in my case, it's giving me problems)"
negative,objective,Right out of the box there was a pixel burnt out in the middle of the screen
negative,objective,This in turn caused the touchscreen to go crazy and render the laptop unusable
negative,objective,When I closed the cover it wouldn't hibernate and would drain my battery
negative,objective,"4gHz (the same as the IdeaPad), had three times the connection as this laptop"
negative,objective,"This laptop is not equipped with a 5gHz card, so it does not talk to the router quite as well as a modern machine should"
negative,objective,"What happens is that most routers are at 5gHz wireless capability, which is simply at a less busy area of the spectrum"
positive,subjective,"At this time and age, it is absolute robbery to sell new systems with wireless capability at 2"
negative,objective,Sometimes the mouse pad works and sometimes it doesn't work
negative,objective,"The whole thing basically turns into a very, very limited laptop that is only useful for word documents and (limited) internet uses"
negative,objective,"1 that is suppositiveed to allow things like skype, netflix, etc to work- the update is not supported and cannot be installed onto the model"
negative,objective,Although there is now an update from windows 8 RT to windows 8
negative,objective,"Instead it took them close to a month and a half, with myself constantly having to call and check up on the status before i FINALLY got it back"
negative,objective,"I sent it to the warranty service, who claimed they would have it fixed withing 7 days"
negative,objective,"Mine broke off after a few months, and the laptop stopped charging altogether"
negative,objective,Neither is google chrome or any other internet browsers for that matter
negative,objective,The ultralow GeForce processor crashes a lot
positive,subjective,"Overall, I have to say my quest for perfect 10 inch Android tablet is over now with this tablet"
positive,subjective,"Because of this, HD movies looks better with this tablet then my Galaxy tab 3 tablet"
positive,subjective,But I can see some might prefer more traditional white screen better
positive,subjective,"I actually like it because it gives you a warm feeling and good for watching movies, etc"
negative,objective,"Compared to that of Samsung Galaxy Tab, this screen is slightly less bright, and this might be due to its somewhat yellowish color temperature"
negative,objective,"I have seen some reviews giving bad rating for its screen qualities, etc"
positive,subjective,* The screen is interesting
negative,objective,"Android became popular because of its standard interface people have become familiar with, and you don't want to deviate too much from it, Lenovo"
positive,subjective,"I agree with everything other people have said here regarding kick stand, battery life, etc"
positive,subjective,"The screen is nice and big, but it is also very thin"
positive,subjective,It seems like a great ergonomic tool and I feel safer holding this than I do holding a regular tablet
positive,subjective,The screen is super crisp
positive,subjective,and I believe the price has dropped again)))
positive,subjective,"BTW, I paid less than my friend"
positive,subjective,"Everything runs fast, videos look clear, and downloaded dolphin browser so it is just like my PC"
positive,subjective,"Not only is it easier to handle, but you can set it up hands free and watch a quick show anywhere"
positive,subjective,"The screen is very good (much better than the Motorola Xoom I'll say), and the built in stand makes a huge difference compared to other tablets"
positive,subjective,"This tablet is a steal for the money, and it's quite distinctive and eye-catching"
positive,subjective,The low price of it makes it even better
positive,subjective,The built-in stand almost makes a case completely unnecessary
positive,subjective,It looks amazing
positive,subjective,"It does everything we would need it to do (social media, Netflix, web browsing)"
positive,subjective,It feels expensive
positive,subjective,Decent quality
negative,objective,Touch screen takes a little getting used to
positive,subjective,Great for a low price
positive,subjective,The build in stand is a nice touch
positive,subjective,Delivery was quick also
positive,subjective,Battery lasts very long compared with my other tablets
positive,subjective,I purchased this great looking tablet two months ago
positive,subjective,It is a bit heavy so holding it up for a long period could get tireing
positive,subjective,The only thing I wish this had is an IR blaster to control TVs
positive,subjective,The screen that a lot of people are complaing about is very good
positive,subjective,"I am a sucker for design so that was what first drew me to the yoga and after comparing specs,  I saw the gt2 and 3 had little over this beauty"
negative,objective,Only down fall is no flash on camera
positive,subjective,"Fast connection, Bluetooth is good too"
positive,subjective,this tablet is perfect for everyday use without the hassle of a laptop
positive,subjective,"I check email, use apps for recipes and social media, and browse the internet"
positive,subjective,"It's fast, its beautiful, its feel really well built in your hands thanks to the metal casing"
positive,subjective,"the color is clear, the graphics can be stunning"
positive,subjective,"However, it looks great, it's not like it has some old pixelated screen from 10 years ago or something"
positive,subjective,I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for affordability as well as quality
positive,subjective,It doesn't have an app drawer but I fixed that with a launcher
positive,subjective,"The screen is fine, better if you ask me, and, once again, the battery life is amazing"
positive,subjective,"This my not be what you want if you want to load big games on it, but I haven't had issues at all for what I use it for"
positive,subjective,"The great thing is the battery last a long, long time"
positive,subjective,I can charge my phone with it if needed
positive,subjective,"ergonomics, very easy to hold and use on plane, at desk, in bed"
positive,subjective,The only reason I turn on my computer anymore is for photo editing and CAD
positive,subjective,Audio experience is excellent because of Dolby Sound
positive,subjective,Battery life stands out
positive,subjective,It feels very durable and has a nice aluminum body
positive,subjective,Battery life is amazing
positive,subjective,"Also, it has an outstanding battery life"
positive,subjective,But the screen has a crisp and clear resolution with good color reproduction
positive,subjective,"Also, works just like our droid phones but larger and faster"
positive,subjective,Typing on it with the stand open is very comfortable
positive,subjective,Battery lasts a long time and we love the built in stand
positive,subjective,The stand is a great feature and I use it all the time
positive,subjective,Video looks amazing
positive,subjective,"The processor is snappy, and I haven't really seen any lag when using apps or watching videos"
positive,subjective,I replaced it with Nova Launcher and everything looks better than my wife's Ipad 2
negative,objective,Lenovo has a very childish looking stock launcher which makes the screen look worse than it is
positive,subjective,"Despite negative reviews about the screen resolution, I took a chance"
negative,objective,"But I do like the 'metal' on the back, it's not the kind that leaves ugly fingerprints"
positive,subjective,That kind of out weighs the whole tablet
negative,objective,"If I had one con, I wish it was a smidge heavier to match the weight of the kickstand"
positive,subjective,Battery life is exceptional
positive,subjective,Mine was charged and ready to go out of the box
positive,subjective,"It's large, VERY crisp, amazing sound quality, great Wi-Fi, touch sensitivity is absolutely perfect"
positive,subjective,The screen is very clear to me
positive,subjective,I was glad I opted for a tablet with GPS as I use my Lenovo Yoga 10 mainly for Astronomy
positive,subjective,"I researched many tablets on Amazon &amp; other websites, finding the best overall price here on Amazon"
positive,subjective,"it's so easy hold the lenovo yoga whereever in bathroom or in bed for long time, most weights fall into the pace my hands hold"
positive,subjective,"we prefer android over windows and ios, since there are more free songs and movie download"
positive,subjective,several key features i appreciate most compared with tablet
positive,subjective,The battery has a long life
positive,subjective,The screen is big and crisp
positive,subjective,Battery life Very impressive
positive,subjective,Good design means easy handling and use
positive,subjective,The screen resolution is more than adequate
positive,subjective,"To wrap it up, for the price point compared to features you cannot beat it"
positive,subjective,With my iPad I had to spend more for a keyboard (at the time) than what this custom KB is going for
positive,subjective,"I'll be getting the snap-on bluetooth keyboard as well, which protects the screen nicely"

positive,subjective,Build could be a bit better
positive,subjective,"They look like DVDs and say something like, &#34;Windows 8&#34; on them"
positive,subjective,"In real life, the CPU is more than adequate for non-gaming purposes"
positive,subjective,"Other than the CPU benchmark scores and the slow (5400RPM) hard drive, the rest of the technical stats on paper for this machine are impressive"
positive,subjective,"Bottom line, don't let the benchmark ratings for this processor fool you like they almost did me"
positive,subjective,"The keyboard has mixed reviews, but I vote FOR it; I like it a lot over my last 6 HP/Compaqs and my mother's Toshiba"

positive,subjective,"The CPU already feels more powerful than expected, but I've ordered a RAM upgrade which should make it perform even better"

positive,subjective,"So far, it feels more robust than expected with the base hardware and weakly-rated processor"

positive,subjective,Good for the price
positive,subjective,Computer is fast and a good buy for the money

positive,subjective,"The display is nice, very clear"
positive,subjective,"The size is great, very light"
negative,objective,"I do not recommend since i am using just to do social media, nothing else and having the network connection dropping all the times is  a big issue for me"
negative,objective,"I just want to let you know that my main problem is that the internet conection is dropping very often, I tried to fx that enabling always the power option since in some technet says that the problem is when is going to save energy"
negative,objective,"WiFi connectivity is also suspect, as Ipad would connect but not the Laptop"
negative,objective,"I have no problems with combining touchscreen and keyboard, but at least 2 of the keys (@ and &#34;) have been cross-wired, and the keyboard is not to international standard (no ? sign)"
negative,objective,"My daughter sent it to ASUS for repair more than a month ago and have had great difficult coordinating for the repair because the repair center does not have a telephone, but a chat and email system"
negative,objective,"This laptop was a present for my daughter after a while, the glass had a crack"
negative,objective,The screen has frozen and multiple restarts have resulted in continued freezing
negative,objective,I'm on hold with Amazon customer service right now trying to figure out how to extract my personal information from this laptop
negative,objective,the fan stopped working
negative,objective,"I purchased this on 2012 for my college, but after 6 months some keys in the keyboard stopped working"
positive,subjective,It's not a problem in my network bc every other device works fine all the time
negative,objective,Actually I had to because the keyboard stopped working
negative,objective,you have to ship it
negative,objective,I bought this in a store just so I didn't have to ship it if something happens
negative,objective,Asia support tried but still wouldn't work
negative,objective,It wouldn't download 8
negative,objective,Now both refuse to install windows 8
negative,objective,It would drop costantly and wound need to be reset to reconnect
negative,objective,The first issue was the wifi connectivity
negative,objective,Second there is the battery which failed after 3 months
negative,objective,First lets start with the trackpad now I have been using trackpads since they came out almost 20 years  ago however this trackpad is unusable for the first time ever I found myself carrying around a external mouse
negative,objective,"in addition, the cable between the keyboard to the screen is very primitive and catches the Usb adapter and the Power on key for the keyboard is very annoying"
negative,objective,after bios exit the is no response at all
negative,objective,1 the computer is not restarting on startup and only after pressing over and over on the keyboard it gets into the bios
negative,objective,The keyboard had a major lag during typing and in general I can say it worked very slow compared to an old Celeron with no Ssd
positive,subjective,"an i5 Zenbook with 128g SSD is much lighter and now sells for $819, making it a much better buy"
negative,objective,"1 month later: The unit is too heavy, keyboard and touchpad  radio disconnect at random"
negative,objective,keyboard disconnects ( virtually ) from mainboard at random
negative,objective,"Keyboard stops working for no reason, despite being fully charged"
negative,objective,Keeps rebooting every 10 minutes without warning
negative,objective,Only USB port is used to connect tablet to keyboard so essentially it has no usable USB port
negative,objective,Tablet part did not recognize keyboard so start-up could not be completed
negative,objective,Customer service is no help either
negative,objective,Its been 10 days and service says its awaiting parts
negative,objective,Sorry to say It failed in 1 week and ASUS said it would fix it in 5-7 days
negative,objective,Barely used for one month and now the keyboard not working at all
negative,objective,But I left it to charge all day and still nothing
negative,objective,Dock stopped working after 4 months use
negative,objective,"Instead, I had to pay $45 to ship the laptop to Asus for them to keep it for 6+ weeks with no expectation of when, or if, I will ever get it back"
negative,objective,"The fact that I paid $800 for laptop and have now been without it for 6 weeks (I have already paid to get a replacement, unfortunately) evidently doesn't mean anything to Asus"
negative,objective,"I have been told a half dozen times that someone will get back to me with an updated status, but no one has EVER contacted me with status information"
negative,objective,No estimated return date has been given; no status updates are forthcoming; no alternatives to just waiting for Asus to get around to repairing it have been offered
negative,objective,"It was sent to Asus for warranty repair (RMA) and, 6+ weeks later, it is still there, ostensibly waiting on a part"
negative,objective,"After four months of usage, the unit stopped booting with a ""boot drive not found"" error"
negative,objective,Asus obviously didn't sell enough of these things to generate discussions on the web
negative,objective,"You have to hold the power button until the unit turns off, and then press again to cold boot"
negative,objective,Pressing the power button again does nothing
negative,objective,"When you press the power button, the screen goes black but the fans are still running"
negative,objective,Obviously ASUS is not capable of designing a wireless keyboard like every other manufacturer in the business that can run for 1+ years on a couple of AAA batteries
negative,objective,You have to turn it off with a switch to keep it from dying
negative,objective,"While I could usually get 6+ hours out of the tablet, the keyboard dies after a couple of hours of use or about 12 hours on standby"
negative,objective,"I also had problems with battery life -- not with the tablet, but with the keyboard"
negative,objective,The laptop was OK - the tablet was heavy and it made it ungainly to move around or actually use it on your lap
negative,objective,After the keyboard stopped working Asus requires both parts to be returned
negative,objective,When the screen rotates the display stops functioning correctly
negative,objective,It requires a cable to charge the keyboard
negative,objective,Still having to reset the WiFi adapter several times a day
negative,objective,No response from Asus
negative,objective,keyboard dock's not working
positive,subjective,"Plus, it is designed properly"
positive,objective,"Cheaper, with the same CPU, memory and HDD, and with a better-that-Retina 3200x1800 screen (instead of the FullHD 1080)"
negative,objective,"Of course you will have to travel with that cable too (or a second charger, not included)"
negative,objective,Building a whole device is a complete different game though and it shows in this display of utter system design disaster
positive,subjective,Specs looked solid and the possibility of separating the screen and transforming it into a tablet was a nice plus
negative,objective,Under heavy CPU load the noise gets some loader but stays white
negative,objective,The fan noise is always present but is low level and &#34;white&#34;
negative,objective,It is top heavy and the hinge does not open up as much as I would like but I could live with that
positive,subjective,The touch screen seems fine
positive,subjective,The actual feel of the keyboard and tochpad is fine
negative,objective,You will need to recover the key yourself or buy a version of Windows
positive,objective,They will reinstall Windows (with all the ASUS junk) if you send the unit in the mail back to them
negative,objective,They refused
negative,objective,Basally someone at ASUS messed up the design and something is draining the battery
positive,objective,The unit does put itself in standby when you don't use the keypad or touchpad and wakes itself backup correctly
positive,objective,The battery in this keyboard until is of similar capacity and is used only for the keyboard unit
negative,objective,When you plug in the laptop you will also have to plug in a keyboard unit
negative,objective,The keyboard will be completely dead if you just close the lid without turning off the keyboard on/off switch and leave it on standby for more than a day
negative,subjective,Your seat mates probably forgot to turn off their bluetooth as well
negative,objective,It probably violates FAA rules to use the keyboard unit on a airplane at any point in its flight
negative,objective,The keyboard must be charged independently and needs charging even more often then then main unit
negative,objective,The dock is completely mechanical; there is no electrical connection between the units
negative,objective,Even when docked the communication is wireless
negative,objective,The keyboard and touchpad unit is truly independent on this unit
negative,objective,Asus doesn't support these products with good customer service
negative,objective,touch screen stop working after one week used
negative,subjective,Asus and Microsoft customer support are both atrocious
negative,objective,"I began to update Windows 8 after activating it, and it failed to configure said updates"
negative,objective,"I contacted tech support, but they were no help; I was able to fix this by fixing the date and time to be accurate"
negative,objective,"Firstly, Windows 8 refused to activate itself"
negative,objective,Still had  a hard time turning it on
negative,objective,8/23/14 After 13 hours updates  are complete
negative,objective,"Will not charge, turn on, nothing"
negative,objective,08/25/14 Tablet is completely dead
negative,objective,Seller sold me a computer that I had to pay almost $300 to fix and both the battery on the monitor and keyboard do not keep a charge
negative,subjective,Not that easy feeling to use
negative,subjective,Also keyboard is big negative
negative,subjective,Can not even think of a new $780 laptop needed to repair in such less use
negative,subjective,Contacted Asus customer support they advised for repairing
negative,objective,computer had cord to attach between tablet and keyboard to instead of going thru the way keyboard attaches to tablet
negative,objective,"had to pay to return to asus to review computer in California, no access to computer for return time"
negative,objective,computer kept going to bios and would not return to windows
negative,objective,I have had mine for 6 months now and the trackpad has now stopped working
negative,subjective,"It is very light, but so is a cardboard box"
negative,objective,The keys are not backlight and tough to see in the dark
negative,objective,The trackpad needs new drivers and software (manufacturer has ones that don't work)
negative,subjective,Processor is slow (and is benchmarked as such)
negative,subjective,The screen is significantly smaller than it should be due to a giant ASUS logo
positive,subjective,It is so wicked and sturdy I have no problem with it even after the fall
negative,objective,It is officially dead
negative,objective,It wont turn on
negative,objective,"And now, it's dead"
negative,objective,"But in less than a week of use, I started to get the error blue screen again and I just gave up and just let it be"
negative,objective,"Finally, when I got it back, they replaced the entire LCD screen"
negative,objective,The repair personnel said that they do not have the part they needed and they have to order it from Taiwan
negative,objective,"And then eventually, on the 6th month, the bottom half of the screen has nothing but horizontal stripes in it"
negative,objective,"And then it got so bad that the blue screen filled with error information just keeps occurring, this time too often, like in less than an hour of use"
negative,objective,"However, in less than 3 months of use, it starts to get the error blue screen and I have to reboot it manually otherwise it will just keep trying to restart forever"
negative,subjective,We will not repair this again
negative,objective,Now we are experiencing random freezes when we unplug and go on battery
negative,subjective,We called and discovered that the ASUS repair facility was overwhelmed
negative,objective,Back to ASUS this time we had to pay for the repair
negative,objective,"Then 3 months out of warranty, the screen crapped out"
negative,objective,"The power light goes on, but the display stays dark"
negative,objective,"After only six months, the ultrabook no longer boots up"
negative,subjective,"Seemed like a great alternative to the Mac Air, but unfortunately, you get what you pay for"
negative,subjective,I'll never buy another Asus product again and I would caution you to be careful when next considering your purchase of an Asus product - because both hardware AND warranty support have not helped me
negative,objective,"It seems even if you ask Asus for support,they cannot / will not help you"
negative,subjective,I would avoid buying ANY laptop with the Asus brand name on it
negative,objective,Unable to save the latest changes because the performance of the computer simply stutters to a halt
negative,objective,"This basically means I have to turn the machine off manually, because the entire system freezes"
negative,objective,The disk drive regularly freezes at 100% in the Windows Task Manager
negative,subjective,Hard Drive Nightmares
negative,subjective,"Maybe, my description is not detailed or defined enough But this pc is driving me nuts"
negative,objective,It loses its settings and the keys are not lit up
negative,objective,"The touch pad is weirdly reacting, the wifi turns constantly off by itself"
negative,subjective,The only solution to this is to completely replace the screen (at a high cost)
negative,subjective,Google search &#34;ux31e screen problem&#34; and you'll see that there are MANY people who have had the same issue
negative,subjective,"I bought the $1,500 model new, and the screen died when it was JUST out of warranty"
negative,objective,This model has a very serious screen issue that Asus has not addressed
negative,subjective,Unfortunaty ASUS support is not very helpful and there are a lot of hidden rock that you can hit
negative,objective,It was impossible to find original new battery without sending laptop to ASUS repairment
positive,objective,"First 6 month laptop worked just fine, could work 6-7 hours without charging etc"
positive,objective,The asus screen is about a 4 out of 10
positive,objective,"My other computer is a macbook pro (2011, non-retina display) and that screen is beautiful, a 10 out of 10"
negative,objective,Tried it with multiple drive and same issue
negative,objective,"My desktop can copy to and from that drive around 80mbps, but this laptop just doesn't have a difference between the usb 2 and 3 ports"
negative,objective,"I've noticed the colder it is, the larger the spot is"
negative,objective,The Bad:  I have this weird oval-shapped circle of moisture in the center of the screen about 1
positive,subjective,"I love the touchscreen concept for a laptop, I'm running windows 7 on this but for some tasks you can't beat the touchscreen"
positive,subjective,The good:  It's got a great processor and 6gb of ram stock means you don't need to spend any more money later upgrading
negative,objective,"Two days after I received it I started having problems with the screen, now after sending for repairs for the THIRD time my issue is still unresolved"
positive,objective,There was a big &#34;amoeba&#34; in the middle of the screen two weeks after purchase
positive,objective,"They'll RMA it for you, and replace it with another defectively designed screen which will work until you fly"
negative,objective,"Clearly a design defect, but Asus support is noooooooo help"
negative,objective,and it didn't even turn on on day 2
positive,subjective,Google Chrome book is the new god of devices
negative,objective,They have to realize that people who have never used Windows before (or coming from a Mac environment) can't intuitively grasp how to use this thing
positive,subjective,"It didn't glide as nicely as my Mac, but I was willing to overlook that  since it's a much less expensive product"
positive,subjective,I loved the color
positive,subjective,"It is physically, sturdy feeling, a bit heavier than I imagined, but overall a nice product physically"
positive,subjective,I've wanted a tablet type thing to carry on the go so I could write anywhere
positive,subjective,"So, I ordered this mostly because it was Red, had the detachable Touch screen and was compatible with my software"
negative,subjective,"Maybe no system does, but since it has no drive and you have to get on the Internet to even get the software sold with it, you'd think they'd put in some minimal virus/malware protection to start off with"
negative,subjective,But some of that came with what my other son calls 'Bloat ware'
negative,subjective,My son downloaded some games - 30 GB worth
negative,subjective,I don't think I would buy this brand again
negative,objective,"Around three weeks ago- internet connectivity is bad, doesn&#8217;t connect all the time"
negative,objective,"The keyboard works fine through login (haven't tried it widely, yet) but stops working with every browser"
negative,objective,"After a factory reset, I've gained control of the errant apps, but now we have the famous keyboard/dock stops responding issue"
negative,subjective,"I don't know yet, but when (if) I figure it out, I'll update this"
negative,subjective,"I hate blaming Microsoft for every hiccup and burp, and it seems to be a hardware issue"
positive,subjective,"If it worked 10% as well as the touchscreen on my HTC One works, it would be an impressive improvement over how it is behaving right now"
negative,subjective,The touchscreen is sluggish and unpredictable
negative,subjective,Ridiculously slow for any task other than turning it on and off
negative,objective,Also the keyboard is complete garbage the slightest movements will disconnect the keyboard from the tablet
negative,subjective,Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage
negative,objective,It also hung the 3rd time I tried to plug in a micro HDMI cable - during a public lecture
negative,objective,"Mine crashed when some USB devices were connected, crashed when the official ASUS VGA adapter was inserted, crashed about 1/3 of the time when the headphones were plugged in, didn't work in standby mode, and even in shutdown mode with a full battery it refused to turn on unless plugged in"
positive,subjective,Thank you Amazon for the great return policy
negative,subjective,2) heavy given how small the screen and unit is
negative,subjective,"1) Keyboard way too small, and I have small hands"
negative,subjective,"Very annoying, constantly have to listen to the tone and push the screen back in"
negative,objective,"2) screen detach itself from latch when open full, causing keyboard not to work"
negative,objective,") it actually says &#34; Plugged in, Not Charging&#34; when AC is plugged in"
negative,objective,1) It will NOT charge at all
negative,objective,Too much money for a new tablet to not be working when it arrives
negative,objective,"Long delay to start up the tablet, system freezes intermittently and loading issues"
negative,objective,"Also, the Windows 8 program would not allow me to download files or change system restore due to a second administrator account that I didn't have access to change"
negative,subjective,"I do not believe this was truly a &#34;new&#34; product as the advertising said, but one that had been sent back to the company (Gimmee Five) and reconditioned"
negative,objective,"Within a day of use (setup, etc) I noticed significant problems accessing programs"
negative,objective,"laptop arrived without any protective plastic over keyboard or screen, which made me suspicious"
negative,objective,The computer's brand new and runs worse than the six year old laptop I was replacing
negative,objective,Battery life is only an hour or two due mostly to the fact that memory and CPU run at close to 100% every second
negative,objective,Touch screen is finicky and often unresponsive
negative,objective,This PC work for 3 hours and would not power on again
negative,objective,"After 1 day of usage, the fan stopped working, and it was not able to power up"
negative,subjective,"System too slow,"
negative,subjective,The touchscreen sucks
negative,objective,The saddest part is the fact that the supplier refuses to reply to my email
negative,objective,"After I spent all this money, I received a laptop that won't even turn on"
negative,objective,The pixals on the screen were boke
negative,objective,My friend knows alot about laptops so he cleaned it for me turns out it didn't even have a virus its just happen to be defective
negative,objective,Support was no help X(
negative,objective,"This guy trying to fix the problem then say, &#34;I can remove the virus but it will cost you $200 i was like pretty much that's what this laptop cost so no thanks"
negative,objective,support so they can help me and tell me what the problem was and he said my laptop had a virus like really how is that possible if I've only used it 3 times
negative,subjective,"Its A Very Nice looking laptop, but I just bought it like not a month ago and it has problems already, called tech"
negative,objective,I tried several things to try to get it to turn on and nothing worked
negative,objective,"When I recieved my computer, it did not work at all"
negative,objective,Got it used it then next day started giving me problems
negative,objective,- I can't access any files or programs
negative,objective,"I opened it and downloaded Chrome, PyCharm, and an ESET antivirus and apparently that was the magic trifecta to make this hunk of crap stop working"
negative,objective,"Very disappointed, this was supposed to be a newer version of the vivobook I had but its not even close I'm just sick that I spent this much money and I still don't have a laptop"
negative,objective,Way to slow feels like dial up all over again

positive,subjective,I went and ordered a Lenovo G505s right before writing this for $50 more with a better processor and graphics card
negative,objective,"On my second Asus the fan was quiet, on this third one of the same model, it's loud, and is much slower"
positive,objective,"The GPU runs games on mid-settings just about, and the laptop stays cool"
negative,objective,The keyboard sinks in the middle quite noticeably
positive,subjective,Essentially this laptop looks fantastic and is from a very reputable brand
negative,objective,"It runs slower, considering all I installed on it was Chrome thus far, and restarted a few times on its own"
negative,subjective,Got this third one a couple days ago and the fan is much louder
negative,subjective,"But with this laptop, quality was hit or miss"
positive,subjective,"Building a gaming rig, Asus was pretty great with the parts I used"

positive,subjective,Games were playable

negative,objective,"For windows 8, this means if you are trying to move the cursor over something, it ends up expanding/minimizing"

negative,objective,"It failed many times, and we talked to a tech specialist on numerous occasions but"
negative,objective,I even wiped out and stared again with factory settings and still same issues
negative,objective,I tried several times and could not get them to repair software conflicts

negative,subjective,"bit of advice is to spend $100-$200 extra for a better, more reliable one"

negative,objective,77 GHz (approx 25%)
negative,objective,Pull the plug and go on battery and the CPU drops to
negative,objective,3 GHz (Task Manager - Performance tab)
negative,objective,"Plugged in, the CPU runs at 3"

negative,subjective,"The keyboard is kind of an important part of the laptop, and this one is weak and fragile and expensive"

negative,objective,We returned the second one because the touch screen worked on and off
negative,objective,We returned the first one because the battery completely drained too quickly - within a few hours
negative,subjective,"Again, tried lots of things, but gave up, returned it, and moved on to a much more expensive (and more capable) Surface Pro 3 which I absolutely love"
negative,objective,"However, within two days, it froze up while in use, no combination of button pushes/etc"
positive,objective,Set up was going smoothly until I tried adding wifi networks
negative,objective,"If the Wifi works, I would give this unit 5 stars"
negative,objective,"Looked at the power light, didn't see any light, so I unplugged and re-plugged, tried again, see the red power/charging light, left it in place for a couple hours, came back turned on, and only about 35% charged"
negative,objective,"- When docking, the screen only tilts back to about 30 degrees angle"
positive,objective,"Re-install Windows took 5 minutes,  (wow)"
positive,subjective,"ISO to USB), and since I only have a copy of Windows 8"
negative,objective,"My Wifi still could not see any SSIDs, even with my hot spot sitting right next to the tablet"
positive,subjective,"Checked my phone, still connecting to my home Uverse wifi, checked my 6 years old but reliable laptop, still online"
negative,objective,"Then boom, can't connect to Wifi, can't see any SSIDs"
positive,objective,"The device looks great, boot to Windows took about 3 seconds"
negative,subjective,Bad customer service
negative,subjective,Instead I called the online store I purchased it from and got a refund and sent the unit back
negative,subjective,I unplugged it just to take a better look at it and then nothing
negative,subjective,"I powered down and  allowed it to charge for 8 full hours, as recommended, before touching it"
negative,subjective,When I first received it I connected it to the charger as recommended and turned it on just to make sure it was working
negative,objective,Went to use it this morning and it is at the same battery level prior to charging
negative,objective,We ended up spending more money and getting her a Mac air book
negative,objective,"They installed helped her move her documents, pictures etc but after using the damn thing for less than a total of 6 hours"
negative,objective,Started up then went into an automatic up date and would not restart from there
negative,subjective,I wish I could get my money back because now I'm stuck with this until it breaks
negative,objective,"The next option, offered by tech support, was to reset my computer to factory settings"
negative,objective,"The instructions were not clear, the links were not links (I had to copy and paste the address given into my browser), and they linked to sites with instructions in Chinese"
negative,objective,Don't contact the technical support; they suck worse then the product
negative,objective,"as is the keyboard: it's loud and the touchpad click is obnoxious; it wakes up the baby when I use it too much, so I don't"
negative,subjective,"Oh, and the touch screen is crap"
negative,subjective,"Which was really annoying seeing as how it showed there was a connection to my wifi, it just decided to not work with that connection until restarted"
negative,subjective,(Usually a fan of ASUS &#8211; but definitely not this model
negative,objective,"This tablet is basically just good for simple browsing and email, nothing more"
negative,subjective,Overall performance is very slow and with daily glitches (hangs)
negative,objective,OS does not work as smoothly as on a Windows Phone
negative,objective,"Heavier than expected, meaning weight is a bit too much for a small device like this"
negative,objective,Office was not pre-installed as advertised
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately they can neither make, nor repair a tablet computer"
negative,objective,Battery failed to charge after two weeks
negative,subjective,But I've seen it happen while running on battery as well
positive,subjective,"This laptop runs great, has plenty of space and the touchscreen works quite nicely"
positive,objective,There are settings to change sensitivity of the touchpad which you may find helpful
negative,subjective,"until I realized it wasn't plugged in to a power source, but was running off battery"
negative,objective,"if it breaks, then the chances of your computer is going to be repaired by someone qualified is very slim"
negative,objective,"There are scratches and glue stains everywhere, the fan does not work and computer overheats"
negative,objective,The screen was crack opened from the frame
negative,objective,The customer support was giving me random excuses about the delay
negative,objective,"They all had issues either straight out of box or they developed issues (trackpad, battery, screen etc)"
negative,objective,but it will heat up and slow down when you need to multitask or run an application that requires a lot of CPU power or RAM
positive,objective,"High resolution, decent reaction speed, and most win8 characteristics available"
positive,subjective,"Fortunately enough, after three days of charging I was able to turn it on when I was writing my final paper for the semester"
negative,objective,I thought the battery was out of charge and charged it for an hour but it still didn't turn on
negative,objective,"However, the first time I got it it did not work"
negative,objective,The model I recieved seems to work fine but it is not what I ordered as I found out when a broken power pack resulted in a lot of confusion when trying to order a replacement
negative,objective,ASUS says that hard drive is damaged and cannot be repaired
negative,objective,In less than 2 weeks of normal handling the computer froze up
negative,objective,Dead as a brick
negative,objective,"It has crashed when using Internet Explorer, it has crashed when moving start screen tiles, it has crashed when there's no activity at all, and it has even crashed when the Charm bar &#34;shut down button&#34; is touched"
positive,subjective,Nice keyboard
positive,subjective,It's a good looking laptop and on first appearances seems well made
negative,subjective,"ASUS seems to have a habit of selling products (I suspect) they know are crap just to make the money up front and then once your committed, let you go through the pain of mailing off the faulty product for an exchange or fix"
negative,objective,"My wife and I both bought (at the same time) ASUS tablets a year ago - both arrived with the same problem, they wouldn't turn on"
negative,objective,I opened the box and the touch screen didn't work
positive,subjective,I purchased this laptop because my research indicated that this was going to be the best product at the price I wanted to pay
negative,objective,Nothing is visible on the screen on trying to power on the machine but indicators are working fine which might mean some problem with the screen
negative,objective,"But alas, brand new laptop, just out of the box, is not working"
positive,objective,What more running other programs such as skype in the background
negative,objective,Took me OVERNIGHT to download chrome and VLC
negative,objective,"After restarting the thing maybe 3 times just to connect to the internet, the windows store still told me ""your PC is not connected to the Internet"""
negative,subjective,"Not only was it SLOWER than my old lappy, but was also harder to use"
negative,objective,"Crashed totally after forth time opening laptop up,  Loving, who sent it to us are lousy,"
negative,subjective,"Never again, big money for this"
negative,objective,I couldn't get it to shut down correctly
negative,objective,It contained Windows 8 so was supposed to have a touch screen but that never worked
negative,objective,"screen brightness is low, reflects everything, whole body gets dirty in minutes, wifi sucks"
negative,objective,buttons get stuck
positive,objective,If you can live with the random shut downs and ASUS apathy to this problem its not a bad computer
positive,subjective,I called ASUS about this and they want me to send them the computer so they can attempt to fix it
negative,objective,"About once a week, out of the Blue it shuts down"
negative,objective,"Earlier today, it decided to overheat and won't even turn on now"
negative,objective,This means the hard drive is about to die
negative,objective,It started to created a loud clicking sound
negative,objective,I just checked the return policy from this seller and you could only return 1 month after purchase
negative,objective,Another charger and battery from the exact same laptop also doesnt work
positive,objective,Even when the power chord is connected it doesn't charge
negative,objective,A bout 2 months later the battery stopped holding charge
positive,objective,"Lucky for me (so I thought), the touchscreen eventually started to work"
negative,objective,"When I first received the product, the touch screen was not working"
positive,subjective,"If you do buy it, get the best warranty you can, as you will likely have to use it"
negative,objective,It restarts with a push of the power button (indicating the battery still has charge) but unfortunately all that you were working on is lost
positive,objective,Sometimes it is just playing a video on the table (not being jostled) and poof
negative,subjective,I couldn't find a reason the screen stopped working
negative,subjective,I couldn't get the screen to work anymore
negative,objective,"At two months later, I finally opened it up because it turned black permanently"
positive,subjective,"I'm good with computers, so I was just going to take it apart and fix it real quickly sometime in the future"
negative,objective,"30 days later, the screen would go black a lot"
negative,objective,"When I got it, the screen went black the second day of owning it for a couple of minutes"
negative,subjective,I have sent this unit back for repair to Asus twice and the problem persists
negative,objective,"Besides not liking Windows 8, this notebook randomly shuts down without warning a few times per week"
negative,objective,"The OS crashed after merely 6 months, and we had to send back to ASUS to reformat the harddisk"
negative,subjective,"Don't like the keyboard, it does not have the mechanical keys feeling"
negative,objective,They can not fix it
negative,objective,"The laptop powers completely down at any time,  while doing anything"
negative,objective,Worst of all it has started making random loud high pitched sounds
positive,subjective,"It it cheap, light, and looks good"
negative,objective,At first a cheap laptop with windows and office seemed like a steal
negative,subjective,"Wow, the incompetence of customer service is really bizzare"
negative,objective,"8 hours later, the tablet is still at 10% charge"
negative,objective,"I opened up the tablet, used it for a day and once the battery was down to 10% of charge, plugged it into the charger"
negative,objective,I finally had their customer service get back to me and issue me an RMA # with very vague and general instruction which I finally was able to dicipher
negative,subjective,For those interested in an affordable tablet are better off looking elsewhere
negative,subjective,"Poor quality product, even worse customer support"
negative,subjective,"For some reason I always associated ASUS as a quality brand in electronics, despite the fact that I've never purchased anything from them before"
negative,objective,""" When I attempted to do so, their website was down and would not allow me to submit that request for days"
negative,objective,"I sent a message to ASUS support, to which I got a reply several days later telling me I needed to submit a different type of ""service request"
negative,subjective,"From the looks of other negative reviews, it's obvious that it's not an isolated issue either"
negative,objective,a charger that has a 12 inch cord
negative,objective,"Anyway, finally, after only 3 months, the tablet stopped charging altogether which meant that in order for it to even work it had to be constantly plugged into the charger"
negative,objective,"When connected to my wireless network, this is the only device that stuters and buffers CONSTANTLY"
negative,subjective,I also noticed that Wifi on this tablet is CONSIDERABLY slower
negative,objective,"Everything seemed great at first, however, after a few months the Tablet started to load a lot slower, crashing more, and losing power a lot quicker"
negative,subjective,for the price I could have gotten a much better tablet but a co-worker raved about hers so I bought it
negative,objective,"Dropped mine even though I had bought the most substantial case that fits only this, and got a cracked screen"
negative,objective,"It does not have a rear facing camera so for taking pictures other than selfies, and videos it is worthless"
positive,objective,"Then, it started repeatedly crashing doing simple takes like taking notes in meetings, browsing the web, and streaming video"
positive,subjective,"To test it out I connected it to a 32 inche monitor, a wired keyboard, and wireless mouse"
negative,objective,"Product looked great, but the battery would not charge"
negative,objective,Gmail takes forever and loses connection and it takes some work to use Google's search engine
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately OpenSource Office doesn't work with our course software (learning management system), and I must use the hated Microsoft Office"
negative,objective,Cannot install MS Office on it
negative,objective,"We researched and read reviews, but only after ordering it we learned that ASUS made their tablet look like Windows 8, but it's only a Windows 8 theme with Android processor, which means the USB port is useless"
positive,objective,A cheap s***ty computer
positive,subjective,I think I got what I paid for
negative,objective,"Asus tech support has, so far, been unsuccessful in fixing the problem"
negative,objective,But today the touch screen stopped working
negative,subjective,"I have only spoken to a live person twice and he transferred me to other numbers where it says &#34;this line is unavailable at this time, please call again later"
negative,objective,I have called ASUS corporate headquarters 12 times and they have not returned a single phone call
negative,objective,The keyboard doesn't work
negative,subjective,Absolutely the worst technical support experience in my life
negative,objective,it never connects to the internet
negative,objective,The touch screen didn't work
positive,objective,"If you are purchasing this for a teenager that merely wishes to access social media programs, netflix or browse the web- this is perfect"
negative,subjective,This is however impositivesible with this device due to the fact that the microphone does NOT work
negative,subjective,Still learning how to navigate windows 8 which is confusing matters
negative,subjective,volume hardly audible
negative,objective,Tiny almost un-usable on/off switch
negative,subjective,"Even when I had spoke two speaking English without heavy accents, non of them could help me"
negative,subjective,"Because I am not familiar with this transformer book, I was referred to call ASUS for help"
negative,objective,It creates slight noise when typing
negative,objective,The keyboard cannot do right click or left click on space bar
negative,objective,"It didn't even start up, after many attempts, we returned for refund"
negative,subjective,"I call to ASUS, spend another 1 hour and they ask me send them back Transformer"
negative,subjective,"I call to Microsoft, spend 1 hour and receive an answer - call to ASUS this is hardware issue"
negative,objective,1 and after upgrade WEB camera stop working
negative,subjective,This company is absolute GARBAGE in every way
negative,subjective,Asus is a bad company and product in every way
negative,objective,Do yourself a favor and buy another brand of computer
negative,objective,"for some reason, between my house and their shop apparently the operating system quit"
negative,objective,Turn computer on and still having connectivity issues
negative,subjective,maybe your signal is bad
negative,objective,I actually set the computer aside for a few weeks since it was taking 5 minutes to open any page and that was IF it would even connect to my wifi
negative,subjective,I will do what I can to stop any one from buying from this company EVER
negative,objective,computer is less than a yr old and been sent back to be &#34;fixed&#34; twice for connectivity issues
negative,subjective,I just want to inform everyone of how TERRIBLE this company is
negative,subjective,"In short, if you're not willing to fix something, don't offer to fix it"
positive,subjective,"Had the ADP Program not been advertised and made to sound like they were on my side, I would have understood some complications and I would have been fine paying for a repair"
negative,subjective,This experience was almost as bad as Time Warner Cable customer support
negative,objective,The expected repair time is another 4-6 weeks
positive,subjective,"After looking into the one year Accidental Damage Protection (ADP) Program on all ASUS laptops, I was relieved that I would be able to send in my computer and have it quickly repaired"
negative,subjective,"From my limited time with the product, it seemed like exactly what I wanted, but my screen shattered and I'm still waiting for it to be repaired"
negative,objective,So even the attempts to make it look like they are addressing these issues are BS
negative,objective,"com as specified in his comment, but delivery failed"
negative,objective,It is having intermittent problems detecting input on the right half of the screen &amp; will occasionally act like I'm continuously touching it in some locations (making it so I can't do anything until I close the screen)
negative,objective,""" I'm now having issues with the repaired screen"
negative,objective,Wifi does not work most of the time
negative,subjective,"It feels really nice, but the one is received is clearly defective"
negative,objective,"One time it was on, I moved it a couple inches and it powered off"
positive,objective,The longest it maintained power (plugged in) was maybe 10 minutes before it just powered off
negative,objective,"I power it on, and then in 3 seconds it just shuts down"
negative,objective,Making the touch screen freak out and the laptop completely useless this type of accident It's not covered in my warranty
positive,objective,The 3rd time I ever opened it the pressure of my thumb cracked the screen down the center
negative,objective,ASUS has not posted an updated video driver since July 2014
positive,objective,It seems like Asus can solve this issue with a driver update that both fixes the bluescreen *AND* doesn't have the framerate issues
negative,objective,"The next game you try to play will hang, and a few minutes later you will get a bluescreen DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE"
negative,objective,"Sometimes, after you have been in a graphics mode (playing a game for example), afterwards the graphics card is left in an incorrect state"
negative,objective,Here is the graphics problem:  Something about the video card in this device is troublesome for the video drivers
positive,subjective,"Spend your money with another manufacturer, you'll be glad you did"
negative,subjective,"As pathetic as it is, I'm writing this on my 5 year old Toshiba laptop because I'm still waiting for my less than 1 year old ASUS to be repaired for the 3rd time"
negative,subjective,"I had the previous model of this for 2 months before I sent it back due to a monitor that kept shutting itself off while my laptop was still open, and it would not turn back on"
negative,objective,"$340 to send it in to a repair shop, and a 3 - 4 week wait without the laptop"
negative,objective,"Tens of thousands of complaints from others, it's a design flaw that ASUS has apparently ignored for at least the last 5 years"
negative,objective,"Next, the charging port went bad, so that I have to physically hold the charger into the laptop to get it to charge, or else it'll just die"
negative,objective,"Finally, at the 9 month mark, the charger broke down and I had to buy a new one"
negative,objective,"Next, I noticed that despite the claims of speed, this ASUS is actually SLOWER than my 5 year old Toshiba with supposedly inferior specs"
negative,objective,"This would not be a big deal if it was occasional, but at least 3 times per day I have to shut the ASUS and reopen to keep my connection, even when I'm in the same room as the  router/modem"
negative,objective,"With the Asus, it consistently loses internet signal, and requires me to close the laptop and reopen to get it back"
negative,objective,"On the one with a charging / battery problem, there also seems to be other issues like the screen color changes and annoying stuff"
negative,objective,"When you move your finger on the touch pad, the mouse does not follow through as you would expect, there some hesitation or delay"
negative,objective,"I bought two units, the first one gives the message &#34;plugged in not charging&#34; and puts a red &#34;x&#34; on the battery"
negative,objective,"Blue Screen of death, updates don't work, don't buy it"
negative,subjective,"this laptop is really slow, it takes me about 3minutes to start it up"
negative,objective,"Call up ASUS to fix this and I get put on hold, and disconnected, so much for being a valued customer"
negative,objective,"Okay works, now it takes forever to start-up, opens applications slower then my 2003 dell desktop used to and when I attempt to open any game program of merit it'll attempt to load it but nothing will happen"
negative,objective,The driver for the GPU cause the Blue Screen Crash with an error message
negative,objective,The GPU is not compatible with the hardware on this unit
negative,subjective,Aggravated and want my money back
negative,objective,"Received the computer yesterday in the mail and the same &#34;blue screen of death&#34;, that they supposedly fixed, happened again tonight"
negative,subjective,ASUS doesn't know what &#34;customer service&#34; is
negative,objective,received the &#34;blue screen of death&#34; stating &#34;driver_powerstate failure&#34;
negative,objective,They also promised call backs from supervisors on at least 3 occasions and I still have never heard back from them
negative,subjective,"Amazon was great enough to offer me a partial refund for the unit, but ASUS refused to do anything"
negative,subjective,"At the end I was so sick of spending hours and hours on the phone with them, paying to have my laptop shipped back time and again for repairs that I gave up"
negative,objective,"Every time I sent it into their 'service' center, the part they replaced failed again within months, or even weeks"
negative,subjective,ASUS has the single worst customer service and warranty program I have ever had to deal with
negative,objective,"There is no one to talk by email on ASUS suport, just phonecalls"
negative,subjective,I will have to fix it by myself
negative,objective,"But My Laptop got broken in Brazil, and ASUS Brazil said they didn't will even look at an internacional product"
negative,objective,Asus was the product of Windows xp but can't deal with Windows 7 and 8
negative,objective,Constantly buggy windows 8 updates that take hours and seems to never complete
negative,subjective,So I pretty much spent $35 to ship my laptop to their facility and didn't have my laptop for a month just for them to send it back without responding to the dispute and to be missing an important part of the laptop
negative,subjective,When I open the box they sent back all that was in there was the laptop and the power brick
negative,objective,They just sent the laptop back in the same condition it was in and didn't fix anything
negative,objective,To make it even worse they didn't even touch the main issue of the fans not turning on
negative,objective,They wanted to charge me $50 to install an HDD bracket that has literally 3 screws on it
negative,subjective,The RMA service however was horrible
positive,subjective,Technical support was really nice they made an RMA for me and I sent in the laptop
negative,subjective,Then to make matters worse after about a week of use I noticed that one side of the fans isn't turning on anymore
negative,subjective,I think for a laptop being so expensive it should at least have both HDD brackets installed when you receive it
negative,objective,"However, to my surprise, there was only one HDD bracket installed into the laptop but two HDD slots"
positive,subjective,I read that buying a Samsung 840 EVO would be the best upgrade to this already amazing product
positive,subjective,My biggest concern was the 5400 RPM HDD
negative,objective,software bloatware that comes preinstalled constantly crashes the video card drivers
negative,objective,I get the blue screen of death all the time
negative,objective,00 to trouble shoot Windows and that it was not covered by my warranty
negative,objective,Within two days of receiving my computer my sound was not working for the computer
negative,subjective,I am just so disappointed because I wanted to like this laptop but each of the 3 times it shipped with a DEFECTIVE part
negative,subjective,Not to mention the FLICKERING of the screen when you boot it
negative,subjective,"3rd laptop (replacement arrived in January 2015): Screen is BLURRY and GRAINY, has random pixelly squares on the screen, and displays white pages as PINK"
negative,objective,2nd laptop (replacement arrived in December 2014): BROKEN HINGE ON THE LID
negative,objective,1st laptop (ordered in November  2014): BROKEN CD PLAYER BUTTON
positive,subjective,"&#34; I wanted to enjoy this laptop so much because it runs games like Guild Wars 2, the Forest, etc"
negative,subjective,"For anyone that's ever built computers, that's not a huge issue, since we prefer our computers to come sans bloatware, but this is a basic function that Windows stupidly stopped supporting in their regular 8"
negative,objective,So you have to download VLC in order for the DVD drive to function as a DVD player
negative,objective,"1, considering this is suppositiveed to be a gaming machine (for which 8"
negative,objective,"On top of that, due to the odd choice of Windows 8"
negative,objective,"Instead, you have to download everything from their site after you register"
negative,objective,"But wait, the system doesn't come with a restore disc or any software option to create one"
negative,objective,"You're more than forced to add a SSD (or at the least, a 7200 RPM drive)"
negative,subjective,Programs like DA:I and WoW boot incredibly slow
negative,subjective,"Then they chose, in the JM models, to include a 5400 RPM HDD, which is laughable on a &#34;gaming laptop&#34;"
negative,subjective,"However, and I can not verify since I don't have the computer at the moment (see previous paragraph), but from their forums, it seems they chose to place two of the four slots for RAM under the case that, in order to expositivee them, would require voiding the warranty"
positive,objective,It comes with a decent amount of RAM with expandability up to 32GB
negative,subjective,"As for the build itself, it's a solid computer on paper with a few odd choices"
negative,objective,"To date, the repair is still in progress, 3 weeks after they received it with no estimate of completion in sight"
negative,subjective,"The rep then stated that they would let me know when the part came in and the repair was completed, apparently not understanding the definition of an invoice"
negative,subjective,"I voiced my issue on Twitter where finally, @ASUS_USA gave me an email address of someone that could actually respond"
negative,objective,"Apparently, &#34;expedited&#34; and &#34;ASAP&#34; are not in the ASUS dictionary as a week later I still had not heard back"
negative,objective,I was told they would escalate the case and someone would get back to me ASAP
negative,objective,It sat in &#34;Product repair in progress&#34; state for two weeks without so much as a call or email
negative,subjective,"I packaged the computer and shipped it off to ASUS, where it was received in the system and visible on the RMA status check"
negative,objective,"I contacted ASUS who informed me that, depsite it being less than a month old and this being the second computer, I would have to pay for the out of warranty repair"
negative,objective,"Finally, after pulling it out of the ASUS branded backpack specifically made for this computer, I went to turn the screen on and found it completely broken as though it had been dropped (but at least the static shocks were gone)"
negative,objective,"About two weeks into this laptop, the screen tearing was more frequent and small shocks would occasionally happen when you touched the metal frame for the screen"
negative,objective,The first thing I noticed after booting up were the dead pixels on the monitor (constant white on black background) followed shortly after with odd screen tearing issues diagonally and curving from top left to bottom right
negative,subjective,"Not being too familiar with NVidia's new GPU powersaving features and ASUS own GPU Boost, I figured maybe the GPU was just disabled for some reason"
negative,objective,", and Arkham Origins) all became either unplayable or playable only at the lowest possible settings"
negative,objective,Wasn't replaced under warranty
negative,objective,Returned but was stuck with $40 in shipping charges
negative,objective,Wouldn't boot up
positive,subjective,purchase one if it doesn't have color issues
positive,objective,There is no known issue regarding the color palette of this device
negative,objective,Why slap a panel with known display issues onto what appears to be an otherwise decent ultrabook
negative,subjective,For ASUS to simply deny the problem and look the other way is a total shame
negative,objective,It is a well known fact that Samsung and Lenovo had to release fixes for this panel that didn't fully fix the problem
negative,objective,ASUS denies that there are color issues and claim to have no record of the same
negative,subjective,I learned my lesson and will never buy Asus brand again
negative,objective,"Now, it has the same problem but it is out of warranty"
negative,objective,It had been sent back to Asus for warranty repair twice and with mother board replaced
negative,subjective,"If i didnt know better, ill refer to this sale as a fraudulent sale, how do you buy a laptop for almost $2,000 and in few days, the screen stand start shaking and in some weeks, the screw loosens and the laptop's screen stand is no more"
negative,objective,Left hinge broke plastic inside so now i can not close the lid
negative,subjective,Screen Assembly failed
negative,subjective,But his color fidelity is horribly awful
positive,subjective,The hardware is good
negative,objective,Metal case &#34;shorts&#34; against the motherboard and the unit won't turn &#34;On&#34;
negative,objective,Have put almost as much in repair costs as the original purchase price
positive,subjective,I like the look and feel of the rest of the computer though
negative,subjective,The mouse pad is too slick
negative,objective,I took a picture of the laptop display (on left) and my desktop monitor (on right) so you can compare looking at the yellow logo of BB
negative,subjective,"Also, the yellow color on the display is so bad, you can't believe it"
negative,objective,"It says &#34;Minimum system requirement not met&#34;, talk to your administrator"
negative,objective,I tried to upgrade but it won't allow
negative,objective,"I was able to connect to the internet on the first day, and then nothing"
negative,objective,The main problem is the flaky wifi
positive,subjective,"Feel, weight, screen are great  (yellow issues are there, but no big deal to me)"
negative,objective,Keyboard was out of order in a brand new laptop
negative,subjective,Too big
negative,objective,Problems with hard drive
negative,subjective,"Also, newly installed Chrome keeps crashing"
negative,subjective,I hate the new start menu
negative,objective,Not enough to watch a whole movie
positive,objective,"If you use one hand to move the mouse and the other hand (or another finger) to left click, it will register as a two-finger right click"
negative,objective,I found out that there is only 1 stick of ram
negative,objective,"Yes, in my picture you can flip it around or move to the bottom outlet, but there are times when that will not be possible"
negative,objective,"The strange colors are caused by taking a picture, but the unreadable text is how it actually looks"
positive,objective,There's about a 10 degree angle from which you can actually read text on the whole screen
negative,subjective,The screen's viewing angle is atrocious
negative,objective,So now I have to spend the time to call ASUS and get it fixed
negative,objective,Started up and then shuts off
negative,objective,Tried to use it this way for a few hours and it now just keeps restarting
negative,objective,Battery never goes over 0% charged
negative,objective,Unplug the cord after charging for 3 hours and it shuts off
negative,objective,the design and built is nice though so I'm sorry it did not work
negative,objective,It constantly disconnects from the Wi-Fi network and while connected the download speed is very low (dial-up like)
negative,subjective,Keys are loud
negative,objective,The spacebar especially is difficult to press down
negative,objective,3) I did a couple of typing tests and I decided this keyboard is not the greatest
negative,subjective,Sorry but this is a major design flaw
negative,subjective,It'll wobble a little even when I type on it
negative,subjective,It makes it look cheap
negative,objective,"However tough the computer actually is, it's totally offset by the nervous feeling whenever you see that screen wobble"
negative,objective,"Anytime you move the computer, the screen will wobble for ages"
negative,subjective,The screen hinge is SO flimsy
positive,subjective,Not incredibly heavy (5lbs) and the flip feature is nice
positive,subjective,Nice metalic feel
positive,subjective,It reminded me of a macbook with the way the keyboard is laid out and the overall shape
positive,subjective,"Upon first opening, I was very impressed with the overall design"
positive,subjective,I've had an Acer Aspire TimelineX for the past 4 years and was looking to upgrade
negative,objective,Opened it and from the start it had a very strong fan noise that didn't subside so I returned it promptly
negative,objective,"should have known, I bought my wife the same name brand  ( From another store ) and her motherboard crapped out a month after getting it"
negative,objective,"The others had mother board failures out of the box,  I called to get it fixed with the extra warranty and the company warranty and they said I would have to send it back and it would be returned in 7 to 10 business days"
negative,objective,Touch screen did not work had to send it back to  ASUS to have it repaired or replaced
negative,subjective,T/ coaster that only if I am lucky I can sell and get some of my money back
negative,subjective,"If you want to buy one by all means, test your luck see how it works for you this was my experience and I just wish I have read a bit more about the wifi and other problems before I purchased or returned it within the return period because now I'm stuck with this non-function $1200+P"
negative,objective,"A system they know not to work, they don't care doesn't work and has problems they don't disclose to you and when you complain and ask for a simple fix to a major defect they tell you to kick rocks"
negative,objective,"Within weeks of having the laptop the wifi, a key material component did not work and had to be returned 3 times in the first 4 months of ownership for a total period of over 6 weeks or a month and a half"
negative,subjective,No A few buck off my next purchase ( assuming I ever buy something from them again)
negative,objective,"Again, the very sorry and apologetic person on the phone told me that it would all be ok they would get a Customer relations manager to call me back within 3 business days"
negative,subjective,"They hadn't replaced the card, it clearly was still not working and I just wanted my money back at this point and they could have the computer because they clearly thought they could get it to work and they could sell it to the next guy but I had no faith"
negative,subjective,At this point thoroughly frustrated I call Lenovo and again very proud of myself explained calmly that this was just not cool any more
negative,subjective,The paperwork says they were able to replicate the problem but I guess they thought oh well tough for him just send it back who needs wifi anyway right
negative,subjective,"The very apologetic support person says that I need to send it back again but I will be put on the ""priority"" list which does absolutely nothing because I am still 10 business days in the depot plus shipping time"
negative,subjective,I very patiently (I am proud of myself) explain the issue thoroughly including the sound issue which precipitated this entire situation still exists
positive,subjective,Well google Yoga 2 pro and wifi for yourself and see
negative,subjective,So again I go to the internet and run some diagnostics
negative,objective,NO the Wifi is still not functional
negative,objective,"Back to Lenovo because as you can read above, you can't open this thing"
negative,objective,Was it put back in loose like my keyboard and the movement jarred it loose
negative,objective,Being a bit tech savvy I run some diagnostics play with the drivers reset the wifi etc
negative,subjective,I tried to bring it back but the adaptor was not there
negative,objective,Well that was the end of my wifi
positive,subjective,In the plane there is wifi interesting I flip my computer on and go to jump on
negative,subjective,They RMAed  it and I patiently waited my 14 business days with shipping and all to get my unit back
negative,objective,"When I first received my unit I was excited, no wifi problems but there was this weird bug which switched stereo to mono"
negative,subjective,Not only too cheap but would rather spend money 3 times shipping a computer back and forward than spend the $35 to fix what is a known faulty card
negative,subjective,It is cheap it is awful it is a deal breaker
negative,objective,"If you are going to build a lap top with limited hard drive space, no ethernet  jack and no ethernet adaptor and which you claim is portable,  it should have spotless wifi or at least functional wifi"
negative,subjective,My major problem is the wifi
negative,objective,Like many other ultra books this is a ye shall not pass type of laptop when it comes to opening it up
negative,objective,Another gripe you will hear is the keyboard in tablet mode does not lay flat so you will always be hitting keys albeit they don't function
negative,objective,Battery life nowhere close to a MBA  but I suppose about 5-6 hours is respectable or at least is when I consider my first laptop was like 1-2 and my old MBP and M11x was like 4-5 on a good day
negative,objective,Obviously non replaceable battery
negative,objective,Proprietary so when it goes you can expect a few bucks to go out of your wallet as well
negative,objective,"Another point of contention, the power supply"
negative,objective,Presentation mode  is laptop mode with no use of your keyboard because you know if you are watching something it is too much of a burden to have the keyboard out and we know how close you have to get to that 12 inch display
negative,subjective,So if my choice is between having a real yellow rather than mustard/golden yellow displayed when I want a regular yellow and a gratuitously over speced display I'd pick the former but that is for you to decide
negative,subjective,"Further, even the differences you can see requires content in that resolution which there is not much"
negative,objective,What that amounts to is tiny buttons and hard to read text if you don't have perfect vision(which I do so it bothers me less but is why I am the joke of my colleagues with less perfect vision)
negative,objective,"Speaking of resolution, it has become a running joke among my colleagues that you can't read the screen on this computer"
negative,objective,"An example of a ""hack"" as my programmer friends would say to fix one problem the quick dirty way but which leaves you with other ""less"" inconvenient problems"
negative,objective,Now navigate to say a Bestbuy and the color of that yellow
negative,objective,"For example, one such problem is look at the color of the review stars on this page, a golden yellow"
negative,objective,"Since then, he has had to return his at least 2 or 3 times because the SD car reader was not functioning among other problems"
negative,objective,"I purchased this ultabook and it was shipped to me February 7th, 2014 and between then and June 1st, 2014 it has had to go back to Lenovo 3 times for periods of up to ""10 business days"
negative,subjective,I will be honest because I am not paid to soup you up to buy this computer or whatever else
negative,objective,Basically they said too bad we got your money you're a sucker shouldn't have bought our product
negative,objective,****Update: Over a week and no returned call or email
negative,subjective,-1 star: Lenovo should be ashamed for replacing Microsoft Security in order to make money for putting on a one month MacAfee antivirus program that you don't need
negative,objective,-2 stars: I lose connectivity and have to reboot nearly everyday
negative,subjective,Lenovo support has been more than unhelpful and just wasted my time
negative,objective,I've probably spent about a total of 12 wasted hours trying to fix this problem
negative,objective,There is a 100 page thread on  the Lenovo support site documenting this problem
negative,subjective,"I love the form factor etcetera, But the wireless problems make it nearly unusable"
negative,subjective,I shouldn't have to send it in for repairs--I should be getting the functional product I paid for
negative,objective,The product was deemed defective by the Lenovo customer service number I called and I immediately asked for a refund the same day I got it in the mail
negative,objective,"This applies to mice I plug in and the touchscreen mouse, too"
negative,objective,"Then, after about 30 minutes, the mouse became completely unusable again as it jumped all over the place and auto-clicked all the time"
negative,subjective,I cant believe that the customer service is this bad for such an expensive product that has such amazing reviews
negative,objective,We spent over $1000 dollars on this Laptop and their only option was for us to send it back for tech support and wait 14 days (which obviously is unacceptable) and they will wave the restocking fee
negative,objective,"Moreover, when I can keep a wifi connection it's slower than any other device on my home network"
negative,objective,I can't connect to my iphone wifi at all although I have figured out how to use the bluetooth to connect to the iphone as an access point
negative,objective,It routinely drops out on my home network
negative,subjective,The wifi on this device is so bad that it borders on absurd that it made it through any sort of reasonable product testing process
negative,subjective,This seems like a total waste of 1300 dollars
negative,objective,"Again, all work data lost, and it is uncertain if it can be repaired"
negative,objective,"The local Best Buy would not accept it for a return even though I purchased the additional &#34;protection&#34;for 4 years, and said that most likely the problem was the motherboard"
negative,objective,"Lenovo has no support, but an online forum suggested that the failure has something to do with &#34;Energy Manager&#34; and that when this malfunctions, it kills the motherboard"
negative,objective,"The machine would not even turn on, so all data is now lost"
negative,objective,"After 3 months, the entire screen went black while I was working on a Word document"
positive,subjective,Love Windows 8
negative,subjective,By the time I get it back the warranty will be out
negative,objective,"They are trying to get Lenovo to agree to just give me a new computer, but that hasn't happened yet"
negative,subjective,Not sure if that was after they tried the HD or not
negative,subjective,But Lenovo should be ashamed of themselves for releasing something that can't even download a few simple games without crashing
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately if all they replace is the HD, I will still have the wi-fi problems and will have to fix that"
negative,objective,I took it back to BB and the guy immediately diagnosed it as a bad hard drive and said they had at least one other person with that
negative,objective,"Then in the middle of trying to work through it, the computer shut down and when I tried to reboot, it said I was missing boot files"
negative,objective,The downloads would stall and repeatedly timed out
negative,subjective,"when I realized that I was using my 350$ acer desktop-replacement laptop more frequently and watching videos with it, as oppositiveed to the yoga pro 2"
negative,subjective,there is no point of having high resolution if the colors are off
negative,objective,"this color problem is minor when you browse the internet, but it is MAJOR when you are watching a movie or tv show, and it discourages the user from watching any video"
negative,objective,"ALL BRIGHT COLORS ARE OFF, LIKE BLUE AND RED AND ORANGE AND GREEN, EVEN WHITE"
negative,subjective,there are widespread reports about negative user experience with respect to the yellow color but PLEASE REALIZE THAT IT IS NOT JUST YELLOW
positive,subjective,the computing power is enough for any task
negative,subjective,"If you buy this product, be prepared to send it in to Lenovo within a year for warranty repair"
positive,subjective,It's design is enough to convince anyone into buying it; this is despite the reality that almost 20% of reviews on this product are one star reviews related to similar defects and major issues
positive,subjective,"This computer is so tempting, so beautiful to look at, such a nice idea"
negative,subjective,"I didn't have any wireless issues, so all the other problems described here were separate issues"
negative,objective,1 functionality problems
negative,subjective,"This computer came with design problems, actual QC problems, and Windows 8/8"
negative,subjective,There are many reasons why laptops may come new with problems and Windows 8/8
negative,objective,"Despite receiving no indications that the BIOS flash failed, I could no longer access the BIOS through Windows 8"
positive,objective,This was a recommended flash from their website
negative,objective,The final straw was a failed BIOS flash
negative,objective,"Like many other people have described, I experienced erratic screen dimming and inconsistency"
negative,objective,"Throughout the entire time that I owned the product, the touchpad would randomly freeze for up to a minute"
negative,objective,"Then came the problems with screen orientation, screen flickering, and the touchpad"
negative,subjective,"Ultimately, this could have been an issue with quality control or something that happened in shipment so I looked past this"
negative,subjective,More light than usual was visible around the bottom edge of the screen
negative,objective,"When I unboxed the computer, I noticed that the backlight around the bottom edge of the screen was abnormal"
positive,subjective,"I bought the Yoga 2 Pro because I wanted to splurge a little, still have something that was portable, and have something I could program and multitask with"
positive,subjective,Best Buy was great about the refund as I was inside 14 days for the return period
negative,objective,"For example, Sponge Bob looks greenish brown yellow, not yellow"
positive,subjective,"After experimenting, I finally got the game playable, WITH 1600x900 AND THE LOWEST SETTING"
positive,subjective,"I was able to run it smoothly on a 2-year-old VAIO with 1920x1080 resolution and almost the highest settings, in the same room"
negative,objective,"Three days later, I discovered that I couldn't even run a common game like Dota 2 without glitching and loosing frames"
negative,objective,"And this happened 2 times before I installed anything, ON THE FIRST DAY"
negative,objective,So I have to reboot the machine
negative,subjective,"The internet drops randomly, while the Yoga in the same room is absolutely fine"
negative,subjective,"I wasn't surprise that my purchase was not scheduled to be sent out within 48 hours, but I was quite upset when I found it was further delayed by 4 days days after purchase"
negative,subjective,"I couldn't find my review on their website weeks after positiveting, so I decided to leave the message here so that potential buyers know the masked issues"
negative,subjective,I would not recommend this laptop because of the poor handling by technical support
negative,subjective,I am very disappointed with technical support
negative,objective,"I called back and my &#34;concern&#34; was escalated, and suppositiveedly a representative will call back within 3 days"
negative,subjective,"After calling technical support and complaining about the delay, I was hung up on"
negative,subjective,"The SSD failed within 3 weeks, which didn't really bother me"
positive,subjective,"Great concept, and while it worked I was very happy with it"
negative,objective,also blue screens of death right form the beginning
negative,objective,the glass on my screen cracked just by holding the screen  with  my thumb
negative,subjective,"As for me, I'll stick with my trusted HP brand that I've been loyal to for years and next time the husband is in the market for something like the Yoga 2, he's for sure not getting another Lenovo"
negative,subjective,Hopefully they fix it permanently
negative,objective,Now it won't even turn on at all
negative,objective,"It wouldn't boot up, kept hanging up on the boot screen"
negative,objective,He'd use it and it would all of a sudden just stop working and he had to use the touchscreen to complete whatever he was doing
negative,objective,In the second month it completely died
negative,subjective,Then I jumped through hoops just the get the bluetooth to work
negative,objective,I spent the first month of owning this machine fighting the Wifi drivers
negative,subjective,Really bad quality control from Lenovo and not sure how all of the defective ones landed in BB and me
negative,subjective,"3rd laptop had the key board working for 2 days and stopped working after that, very annoying"
negative,objective,Bought this from Best Buy and exchanged 3 times so far and key board gets disabled as soon as I login (Can type the password)
negative,subjective,"Lenovo customer support would be a sad joke, had it even existed at all"
negative,objective,Google Lenovo wifi problems
negative,subjective,After an hour with tech support I decided to send it back
negative,objective,It arrived from the factory and I could not connect to my wifi though I have numerous other items connected without a problem
negative,objective,Super wifi problems
negative,objective,"6&#34; laptops have soldered in memory, so they are not upgradable"
negative,objective,"Ideapad owners have to use the non-english speaking, out of country tech support who act like you don't know what your talking about"
negative,objective,"You can&#34;t even use Thinkpad tech support in Georgia, USA"
negative,subjective,Windows new format confusing
negative,subjective,Short battery life
negative,subjective,5 hrs max and sometimes less
negative,subjective,Battery life is awful and unacceptable
negative,objective,Battery barely lasts 1 1/2 hour
negative,subjective,I purchased this only because I needed a PC based laptop for work and now I wish I had not wasted my money on it
negative,objective,Right now I have a $350 paperweight
negative,objective,"I have tried resetting to the factory install, still have the problem"
negative,objective,No one can figure out why it's doing this or give me a fix for it
negative,objective,Now I have a laptop with no key top of the 8 and it still fills in every damned field with 8s
negative,subjective,"I very gently pried up the key as per the directions (which, of course, broke) and still the 8s kept coming"
negative,objective,"There is some error in the system somewhere - as soon as you open it, it starts filling in any empty field with the number 8 continuously"
negative,objective,LAN stopped working now Microphone stopped working
negative,subjective,"worst laptop ever battery life very short, garbage, no better features"
negative,subjective,also the key pad is flimsy
negative,objective,the battery life is non existant
negative,objective,"I have reinstalled windows 8 many times on this machine, the most unreliable computer I have purchased in the past 20 years"
negative,objective,"As of yesterday, Google play locks up, tablet is slow to respond on everything"
positive,subjective,Good for what i paid for
negative,subjective,The physical design is great - everything else is unacceptable
negative,subjective,"The second one was drastically slower, needed to be reset twice to get the Bluetooth to work, had intermittent video problems and after being charged overnight, had only a 35%  charge"
negative,objective,"92 days after delivery, the video had a total failure"
positive,subjective,"The first one was, indeed, slow - but the price was good enough so I felt alright"
positive,subjective,"I really don't mind not having the latest thing if the price is right, and even after reading reviews of how slow this unit is decided to give it a go"
negative,objective,"apk package update from About device, System update will fail"
negative,subjective,"I guess I'm going to have to go w/Samsung as I should have originally when comparing tablets, I just didn't want to pay about $100 more, but like it is said, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;"
negative,subjective,"Was very excited when I 1st received the tablet and 2 weeks later it just stop working, no reboot"
negative,subjective,I'll not be buying this brand again
positive,subjective,I am a fairly tech savvy guy and have had less expensive tablets last for a very long time
negative,objective,The third one lasted three days and it just completely died
negative,objective,The first two locked up after a week
negative,subjective,If I'd bought from somewhere else who knows if I would have ever got my money back
positive,subjective,"It's just fortunate that I bought these through Amazon, which is an outstanding company and has been very good about making this right"
negative,subjective,I'm sending the &#34;third&#34; one back and getting another brand this time
negative,subjective,"Shamefully, Lenovo has been very silent in responding to the posts"
positive,objective,"Update 8/26/14:  The Lenovo forum continues to show many, many new positivets containing complaints about the upgrade to version 4"
negative,subjective,"Lenovo's customer service, or lack thereof, is unexcusable"
negative,objective,And they are completely absent insofar as responding on the above-referenced thread
negative,objective,4 Kit Kat continues to cause major problems
positive,objective,Update 8/4/14:  The system upgrade to 4
negative,subjective,"Until Lenovo (a) demonstrates better customer service and (b) fixes the upgrade problem, they deserve one star"
negative,subjective,"It's terrible customer service and this fact should be carefully considered if you are in the process of deciding whether or not to buy this, or any, Lenovo product"
negative,objective,No one from Lenovo has replied on the forum concerning the version 4
negative,subjective,"Worse yet, there has been no official acknowledgement of the problem"
negative,objective,"4 upgrade not function properly, but there appears to be no way to downgrade to version 4"
negative,objective,"4 Kit Kat, and feedback on the Lenovo forum has not been good"
positive,objective,"However, Lenovo recently pushed out a system upgrade from version 4"
negative,objective,I have had this tabled six months and it is dead won't charge and won't turn on when plugged in
negative,objective,This machine will not turn on
negative,subjective,You get what you pay for
negative,objective,"Also, when I tried to submit this review, it couldn't happen because the wifi is just that bad"
positive,subjective,"I understand that this is a budget friendly laptop, but acceptable wifi should be standard"
negative,objective,The keyboard keys stick sometimes (also a problem I see with my dad's HP
negative,subjective,Even my iPad received better internet access than this
negative,objective,I am in a 700 square foot apartment and cannot receive internet access across the apartment
negative,subjective,I spent the last 3 hours online trying to find a solution for the TERRIBLE wifi that comes with this laptop
negative,objective,And lenovo global service guyz said they are getting the panel to India even after 3 months and they gave up
negative,objective,"They asked us to use as is until the replacement part comes but sadly in next few uses, Touch panel completely broken"
negative,objective,"Within one month of light use the touchscreen started malfunctioning, a few weeks later the display stopped working, and a few weeks following that the screen would not open and got locked up"
negative,objective,"The U310 costs less than other laptops with similar features, and our experience may explain why"
negative,subjective,"Some reps are more informed than others; we received three different sets of instructions for returning the laptop in three different calls, resulting in multiple trips to FedEx before they would accept the shipment"
negative,objective,"Each call is handled as a new event, so there is no way to identify units that are simply lemons, and no means to get a replacement or other consideration for multiple issues with the same laptop"
negative,objective,The Lenovo helpdesk seems designed to maximize the time spent on the phone to discourage calls
negative,objective,I am sending it back today for what they tell me is a bad SSD
negative,objective,"Last week, though, it began to randomly blue screen and then would not boot up"
negative,subjective,I believe that Lenovo lost the quality lessons inherited from IBM
negative,subjective,Even the wired connection is slow
positive,subjective,I have installed a couple of external WiFi USB adapters
negative,subjective,Lenovo support is another difficult item to deal with
negative,objective,Walk a few feet away and your internet connection is gone
negative,objective,Lenovo Ideapad U310 has serious issues with the Wi-Fi It works very poorly in the same room of the router
negative,objective,The latest problem is that the hinge holding the screen to the keyboard is now breaking apart
negative,objective,"However, if it goes to sleep when I attempt to start it up again, the system locks and has to recycle itself (same as before)"
positive,subjective,"I have always had Dell products in the past and would have done so again except they did not have the small, light laptop I was looking for"
positive,subjective,I have very little faith that they will repair it so it will work satisfactorily
negative,objective,It is very difficult to explain any situation at all to them from the problems with the computer to issues regarding the return of the computer for repairs
negative,objective,A word about Customer Service: while the service techs may speak English (more or less) they do not understand English
negative,objective,It worked one time and then repeated the same error
negative,objective,This continued to occur every time the computer went into sleep mode and/or I tried to start it up
negative,objective,When attempting to start the computer a blue screen appeared saying there was a problem and the system was gathering data and attempting to resolve
negative,objective,"However, I bought this in the beginning of July (it was delivered 2 weeks later) and in the beginning of September the computer would not start up"
positive,subjective,"I bought this laptop because of it's size, weight and because it had a touch screen"
negative,objective,"Tried everything, called customer care but no positive response"
negative,objective,"It will not start up, it stucks at the boot menu and will not reboot"
negative,objective,It screen flicker randomnly
negative,objective,WiFi was the issue that I was worried about but later on I realized that it is not the only issue
negative,subjective,I read Lenovo online forums and found reviews with users complaints for wireless connectivity
negative,objective,"The unit delivered to me, could not get wireless connectivity at speeds which I got on other laptops I used in same room"
negative,subjective,I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere for a dependable laptop
negative,subjective,"I dished out $140 for ""premium"" technical service from Lenovo"
negative,objective,Couldn't get wifi access from the day I bought this piece of junk
negative,subjective,"Worst laptop ever, WiFi suck, wired internet plug is loose so every time i move it it looses connection, windows 8 suck windows 8"
negative,subjective,So we returned it for a refund minus the 10% restocking charge
negative,objective,It was not a true Windows 8
negative,subjective,"the worst  operative system that I have bought, you cant download nothing  from the net, need purchase from the windows store and they have  just a few of program, you cant use  crome or any other navigator, I really don't recommend this slow yoga"
negative,objective,"Unfortunately, there's no ethernet port as a workaround"
negative,objective,"Most importantly though, the wifi cannot keep a connection to my local network"
negative,objective,"Other than the OS however, this machine is painfully slow even for basic tasks"
negative,subjective,I learned the hard way windows RT is complete junk
negative,subjective,I'm extremely angry and it was not worth how much I paid for it anyway
negative,objective,I checked it out for a while and it turns out that it's more of a tablet then computer so you can't download iTunes and a whole bunch of other things that I would want
negative,objective,"Might be more of a software issue, but no help was provided"
negative,objective,Well whatever the stylus part was more messed up because it doesn't draw straight lines
negative,subjective,It was an awesome laptop until I realized windows RT meant I couldn't use external software and applications
negative,subjective,Screen is poor  and blacks out and I only had it 2 months
negative,objective,couldn't get used to windows 8
negative,objective,"Of course Lenovo wont help, best buy wont help ( thry wont even buy it back) and a few engineers who I know said it was a piece of garbage"
negative,objective,"Then, it locked up just randomly"
negative,subjective,Then if you closed it in any way it would freeze up
negative,objective,When we switched it from laptop to tablet it stopped responding
negative,objective,The closed interned is AWFUL
negative,subjective,Except maybe an unethical owner who decides to take advantage of my lapse in judgment for not insuring the package or requiring a return receipt
negative,subjective,"I called again two weeks later and learned that the package was picked up from PO Box 1794 Zipcode 30052 on June 18, 2013"
negative,objective,The clerk at the positivet office told me that the package was delivered but not picked up
negative,subjective,I called the positivet office to ask if the package was picked up
negative,subjective,My mistake was that I did not insure the package since the mailing cost me about $24
negative,objective,"Well, turns out that is a misdirection because no memory upgrades exist"
negative,objective,I have been waiting for another month for Lenovo to tell me how they intend on fixing the problem
positive,subjective,First I must say the Thinkpad Tablet 2 is a beautiful machine and my past experience with Thinkpads has been 100% positive
negative,objective,"the Seller, Portable Guy, finally gave me a refund but now we are arguing over the shipping charges"
negative,objective,Would not power up
negative,objective,Would not take a charge
negative,objective,what is the quality control at lenovo to send out a tablet advertised as &#34;brand new&#34; factory sealed and it is broken from day one
negative,subjective,"I loved this tablet at first, but after 3 weeks, my right speaker started hissing and was faulty"
negative,objective,"I really don't know what kind of service Lenovo provide here: brand new defective product, no local support"
negative,objective,But Lenovo service provider in my country refused to fix it and told me to send it back to US just because it got no international warranty
negative,objective,After looking deeper you will find the battery is a real issue and that's why we may never see our tablet back to return
negative,subjective,We have only had Lenovo products for as long as I can remember but have been advised to look for another manufacturer
negative,objective,"com/support/ezserv, I was sent a box to send the unit in for service (two weeks ago) and still no idea when or if I'll ever see it"
negative,subjective,"Be aware that service on these is terrible, I got one through work off Amazon and it was dead on arrival"
negative,subjective,"As a science student my advice is, DO NOT waste your time and money for this crap"
negative,subjective,The stylus is also not that good and its default software is microsoft word which works extremely slowly
negative,objective,"Windows app store is another tragedy, very limited, and you have to pay for several apps that you find them in apple or android store for FREE"
negative,subjective,"Windows 8 is vey slow, you cannot keep multiple apps open"
negative,subjective,"1, but surprisingly the quality is much worse"
negative,subjective,It is more expensive than Ipad 2 and Samsung galaxy note 10
negative,subjective,But is money I can't afford to lose
negative,objective,It won't just read the battery
negative,objective,just that now has a battery issue
positive,subjective,"After I got the money back, I decided to buy it again because I really like the tablet, and I just got the second one a few days ago"
negative,subjective,Customer support is good but development and the releasing of new drivers is the problem
negative,objective,1 because of numerous drivers and bios issues
negative,subjective,I have learned a very expensive lesson when dealing with Lenovo
negative,subjective,"My only &#34;question&#34; is did the seller, OEM Genuine, sell us a new tablet to begin with"
negative,objective,"Wont reboot, tries to update Windows, white and black lines through the screen, not able to function"
negative,subjective,The battery isn't nearly as good as it was advertised
negative,objective,"I was quite excited to get this, but unfortunately the device itself will not connect to any wifi source, and it is incredibly slow"
negative,subjective,Very slow
negative,subjective,Good for checking email and not much else
negative,subjective,"I mean, what labor does it take to open a case, do they buy in a refurd and send it out rather than fix the flawed device"
negative,objective,"This is a common problem with the device made worse by the fact that the service is highly expensive, basically it costs just as much to throw one out and buy in a new one"
negative,objective,no amount of charging or Lenovo advised tricks to get it up and running seem to work
positive,subjective,"Bought this device and used it a handful of times, it carried me over from London to Amsterdam, did well for me at work when my keyboard failed and the stylus came into its own like a miniature superhero"
negative,subjective,I tried to contact seller for tech support and their response was really disappointing
negative,objective,It would give you a lot of problems regarding drivers charging booting and updates
negative,objective,"The windows 8 is get autolock randomly, sometimes after 15 minutes but sometimes every next seconds"
negative,objective,"The mini USB charger was not charging, when I connected the charger the power icon says &#34;Connected but not charging&#34;"
negative,objective,"Also when connected to projector, it is very difficult to write on it"
negative,subjective,This is very slow tablet
negative,objective,"Completely useless tablet, super slow and laggy, the pen sucks and isn't accurate around the edges"
negative,objective,"A year after I purchased it, the tablet stopped charging again"
negative,objective,"However, the tablet continued to be sluggish and glitchy"
positive,objective,"First, the tablet stopped charging about a month after I purchased it"
negative,subjective,Trying to ship it back and get the replacement
negative,objective,The LCD was damaged
negative,objective,"I thought I bought a laptop, but I clearly only bought a way for Microsoft to collect data about me"
negative,subjective,I need a MSN account to power the unit on
negative,subjective,I was able to fix this on my &#34;desk top&#34; PC but not on the laptop
positive,objective,This laptop freezes within 1 minute of turning it on
negative,objective,Second problem is that it will spontanously zoom in or out
negative,objective,"No solution offered, expect to return it and pay $100 more for the same computer"
negative,objective,The screen will not light up
positive,subjective,The computer is defective
negative,objective,Computer was not functioning properly on arrival
negative,subjective,The turntable sound fine but what records is nothing but distortion and skips
negative,objective,Tried loading a &#34;vinyl to disc&#34; software program and its awful
negative,objective,The battery says 5 hours of use but its more like 2 hours unless you keep the screen so dim you can't see anything
negative,subjective,The mouse pad is too far to the left
negative,objective,You have to hit the buttons with a good deal of force to make them work
negative,subjective,"The  keyboard is awful, and the &#34;enter&#34; key is so tiny"
negative,objective,It goes to wait states and freezes and even Ctrl-Alt-Del does not respond
negative,subjective,Solid piece of hardware but seems like Windows 8
negative,subjective,I do not have time to deal with the repair so I am returning the lap top
negative,objective,I cannot recommend the Lenovo Yoga 2 11 because  the on button breaks too easily and the Lenovo warranty terms are ridiculous
negative,subjective,"If the local bricks-and-mortar store where I bought my still-under-warranty Yoga 2 11 can repair it, then I should be able to take it there and have it repaired"
negative,subjective,"If Geek Squad can do the repair at the place where I bought my unit, why all the shipping"
negative,subjective,"According to this same person, I could take it back to Best Buy and have the Geek Squad fix it at my expense"
negative,subjective,"And the whole time I am without my computer, the term of the warranty just keeps ticking away a fact confirmed by the person I spoke with in support"
negative,objective,When something as necessary as the ON button breaks I don't think that's a good sign of a quality piece of equipment
negative,objective,"Unfortunately, my power button will no longer turn the unit on or off"
negative,subjective,If I can't use Office on this unit then it's only purpose would be a door stop
negative,subjective,Customer service and satisfaction should be a Number 1 priority
negative,subjective,"I could not get Office 2013 to work on this computer, Lenovo charged me $70"
negative,objective,Note that the price of the Lenovo Yoga is going down every day
positive,subjective,I did buy a MacBook Pro (refurbished from Apple for a less expensive price) and am much happier
negative,subjective,i deleted the printer and this never has happened again
negative,objective,I thought the printer was bad until i realized this crappy computer was sending out the erroneous messages
negative,objective,"Another novel thing the Lenovo did was that as soon as I turned it on, my home printer would mysteriously start up and spew out gibberish pages for no reason"
negative,subjective,I have taken it out of my office and it is being reduced to only some very isolated Windows tasks
negative,subjective,I only bought it for some job requirements that were Windows only
negative,subjective,"Guess what , it is gone on Windows 8"
positive,objective,"The one decent thing Windows had was the ""Start"" icon to view programs quickly"
negative,subjective,A bloated operating system
negative,objective,"Dropping of wifi connections, Crashing due to Adobe Flash issues"
negative,objective,i have had this for several months and can state unequivocally that the whole Windows 8 is another failure
negative,subjective,A typical Windows piece of junk
negative,subjective,Another USA company going to china to buy junk
negative,subjective,I fear my one year warranty will not make it
negative,subjective,I am on my third hard drive for the new replacement that had same problems
negative,objective,"Jams up, won't shut off, freezes"
negative,objective,its not touchscreen as the ad says
negative,subjective,"The computer itself runs fine but I no longer have the ability to Skype, listen to movies and so on without headphones, and any related procedure"
negative,objective,"Within two months of purchasing, the Conexant speaker/microphone system failed"
negative,subjective,Twitter app unusable because Adobe Flash is not fully compatible
negative,subjective,"Terrible, slow wi-fi"
negative,subjective,"It must have lost it's charge, and then battery wouldn't recharge"
negative,objective,He used it 3 days and then it wouldn't turn on
positive,subjective,"Google now, which seems to be voice activated program, is one that has been talked about a lot, but I've not used it"
negative,objective,"And yes, there are a lot of features on this phone that will probably never ever use"
positive,subjective,I thoroughly enjoy using this feature
positive,subjective,"As far as holding charge goes, well, I can't complain here"
positive,objective,"There is a curved back; although the professional reviews love this feature, this is nothing really that special to me"
positive,objective,"The phone is about the size of an IPhone 5, but has a bigger screen"
negative,subjective,"To be fair, it is a generic charger I use at work not the one that came with the phone, so I can't tell whether it's a phone issue or whether it's because of the generic charger"
negative,objective,"The other weird thing is that when I am charging the phone, sometime when I am typing the keys jump all over the place"
negative,objective,The other thing I dislike is the new music player
positive,objective,I put the camera icon on the first screen; this accomplishes the exact same thing as the camera shake
positive,objective,The greatly hyped camera shake works about 2/3 of the time
negative,subjective,"Of these three functions, the GPS was the hardest thing to figure out"
positive,objective,"The GPS, once I figured out how to use it (and the differences between high, medium and low (and honestly, low is fine)) worked like a charm"
positive,subjective,"The text messages work well, too, with fun little emoticons with everything from smile faces to cake to the moon"
positive,subjective,"For calls, the phone works well"
negative,objective,"As I have not used them, I cannot fairly remark on them"
negative,objective,"I've had the phone for about two weeks now and there is a lot packed into this phone, much of which I am sure I will never use"
positive,subjective,I had unlocked the phone and brought it with me in my travels both in and outside of the US; the phone had served it's purpositivee and life
positive,objective,It had a good run for a smartphone; mine lasted about three and a half years with the original battery and without a factory reset
negative,subjective,"Six months passed and I decided after countless times of the GPS randomly stopping working and the phone freezing, it was time to say goodbye to the Samsung Galaxy S (1)"
negative,objective,quick acquire did not work
negative,objective,"- In spite of 10 mp, camera performance not great"
positive,subjective,"7', neither too small nor too big)"
positive,subjective,+ Perfect screen size (4
positive,objective,5 inches screen with stylus to just edit a few documents or watch YouTube or listen to  Pandora
positive,subjective,"I don't need a quad-core processor, or a 5"
negative,objective,Also the battery is not easily removable which makes replacing them very difficult
positive,subjective,"I bought the Bear Motion case for it here in a snazzy green, it's sort of a textured surface case and it's very neat and has held up better than I'd have expected"
negative,subjective,"Anyway, that's my gripe and I wanted to share it in case others find it useful"
positive,subjective,Galaxy S4 took lovely photos - almost like what I'd expect for a regular trusty little point and shoot style camera rather than a camera phone
negative,subjective,"I just find its ability to deal with light very lacking - not just low light situations, but even situations like light sources coming in from the side and so forth, and many of the photos appear slightly blurred or overexpositiveed to me"
negative,subjective,"If you like taking photos and want high quality, this might not be the phone for you"
positive,subjective,I am amateur at photography and for an actual camera I use a SONY NEX model
positive,subjective,"I am no camera pro, but I enjoy using my phone's camera a lot, and take a lot of memento and shared photos with it"
positive,objective,"But other times, I can command &#34;Ok Google, navigate to 123 Main Street"
negative,subjective,Trying to get it to start up navigation to a certain address seems to be particularly problematic
positive,subjective,I find the actual voice recognition to be quite good - it rarely misinterprets what I say
positive,subjective,"You wouldn't think it would seem like a big deal to have to push the button to un-sleep the screen, but being able to glance at the phone like a watch is very nice"
positive,subjective,"I specifically chose to purchase this phone because I liked the sound of several of the unique features, and I do not regret the purchase"
negative,subjective,"However, I'm frustrated that storage isn't expandable, and the price point seems a bit too high"
positive,subjective,"The processor is crazy fast, the cameras are both great, and I love that there is almost no bloatware"
positive,subjective,"The functionality, and features of this phone are generally working as expected"
negative,objective,The only other big con is the lack of replaceable battery
positive,subjective,I also use the motorola connect feature to text from my PC everyday
positive,objective,"I was initially surprised that there was no notification led, but I've now come to appreciate the active display more than a notification LED"
positive,objective,The active display may be the biggest day-to-day win
positive,objective,"The touchless control (waking the phone by saying &#34;OK Google Now&#34; without touching it) isn't a must have, but it's occasionally useful"
negative,subjective,It feels fairly stock AOSP
positive,subjective,I like the direction motorola took for their android modifications
negative,subjective,"I customized mine through moto maker, which is a nice touch - although after dropping it one time and noticing significant scratches I ended up getting a case that pretty much obscures the customization (and actually makes the phone larger than the galaxy nexus in my pocket)"
positive,subjective,Moto X is a great phone for the price
positive,subjective,It feels the same in my pocket though - which is fine
negative,objective,The size of the phone is slightly smaller than the galaxy nexus - while having a noticeably larger screen
positive,subjective,I haven't used a 1080p phone yet (1080x1920) and maybe someday I will think that's a base resolution
positive,subjective,It's great to have so many pixels on the screen
negative,objective,Also you cannot add a SIM card for additional memory
negative,objective,I don't believe you can replace the battery so it is a throw away like most everything
positive,subjective,Touch screen is good
positive,subjective,Easy to use good photo quality
positive,subjective,"Great, my first android phone, so loving it"
negative,objective,My only issue is that it took a few hours to associate with my carrier (LIME)
negative,subjective,the only thing i can complain is the camera
positive,objective,customer service quickly solved the problem
negative,objective,There is a small crack on the right side of the phone
negative,objective,The only thing is the battery is lately draining faster than the first days
negative,subjective,"I was afraid it would be a Chinese copy but it actually came in the original box, brand new, perfect conditions and even Before the estimated day"
negative,objective,When repair is complicated
negative,objective,Your problem is that the front glass is delicate and is glued to the LCD
positive,subjective,Slim and lightweight
positive,subjective,Pretty fast
positive,subjective,"It's quick, good for one handed use, great screen, decent camera"
positive,subjective,Great phone for anyone but especially those who want an easy phone to use (when Android typically can be complicated)
positive,subjective,The feel Is wonderful
positive,subjective,I think for the price it is a great for
positive,subjective,"The battery isn't very good, but it is nice"
positive,objective,"For my price point this phone is great, but if money were no object I would probably opt for a spendy iphone just because of the camera"
negative,subjective,Other phones in my price range were bigger and I didn't like that
positive,subjective,I like the size of the phone a lot
negative,subjective,I love the twist of the wrist to activate the camera but the camera itself doesn't take great pictures unless you have ideal lighting
positive,subjective,The camera is definitely the weak link with the phone
positive,subjective,thank  you amazon and mango  wireless for the no hassle return  and great customer service
negative,subjective,reception was bad  also
positive,objective,battery drained suddenly two  different times
negative,subjective,I dont know how to get rid of AT&T; phone book though
positive,subjective,Excellent phone with good battery life and plenty of power for my requirements
positive,subjective,Good quality phone
positive,subjective,"Very nice, arrived in time"
positive,subjective,The only thing that could get better is the batery
positive,subjective,Camera is impressive
negative,objective,Although it says that its an unlocked version The phone carries At&t; logo
positive,subjective,Phone arrived on time and works great
positive,subjective,Super fast and responsive
positive,subjective,"Great phone, good battery life"
positive,subjective,It was much less expensive than other unlocked phones
positive,subjective,"The camera works OK, it was my main reason for purchasing the phone with data &amp; cell service"
negative,objective,"Due to language barriers, the errors the phone gives me can't seem to be fixed by the mobile phone companies in town"
positive,objective,Some difficulties using it overseas on foreign networks but overall it has been a great phone
positive,subjective,Active display is amazing feature
positive,subjective,Good phone with engaging price
positive,subjective,"Nice device, it looks and work fine"
positive,subjective,hopefully will be better with next update
positive,subjective,I also like that this is more stock android so you have function of the OS and not BS skins that get in your way
positive,subjective,Battery life is not bad but with Android Lollipop that should be fixed with a 30 percent boost
negative,subjective,I don't care about BS specs and a huge screen that will disable me to use the phone with one hand
positive,objective,There are other cool commands that people don't know about like asking &#34;Ok google play music or play Pandora&#34;
positive,subjective,I only switched because this phone has some great useful features unlike the Samsung models
positive,subjective,I wasn't planning on switching to Android for the first time but it happened and I'm happy it did
positive,subjective,And obviously more comfortable in my pocket
negative,subjective,I thought I'd prefer a bigger screen but I really got used to the 4
negative,subjective,And all for half the price of the bigger more expensive phones
positive,subjective,Camera is very good
positive,subjective,It is a very good android phone
positive,subjective,A extra gig of ram would have really helped in a few places too
negative,subjective,Not sure if it's positivesible but stock Google play rom on this phone would make it shine and remove any quirks I found like no access to quick toggles in the notification pull down menu
negative,subjective,This could be a bug in the Ice Cream Sandwich rom &#34;The phones OS&#34; and could be fixed when the phone gets the Kit Kat update
negative,subjective,I have Bluetooth in my car and the music skipped like a scratched cd
negative,objective,The first day the battery had 50% life out of the box
negative,subjective,I have a very large music collection and running Player Pro in album view scrolled and rendered album art very quickly
negative,objective,The bright vivid colors and the touch input was dead on every time
positive,subjective,I was very happy with the quality of the IPS display
negative,subjective,I can't use any display that isn't IPS and low resolution
negative,subjective,The display had to be as good as a iPhone 4
negative,subjective,Memory is a big one for me as I have a large music collection and don't want to waste my data on streaming music
negative,subjective,I was looking for 4 things I wanted most from a phone
negative,subjective,I got factory reset and nothing changed
negative,objective,"Cannot find mobile network and constantly showing me ""unfortunately com"
negative,objective,Here mongolia has all providers band is 2100mhz
negative,objective,But device 3g band is only 1900mhz
positive,objective,oohh everywhere I go everyone seems to like it because of its unique color and the fact that its thin and sleek
negative,subjective,"I think it could be a bit bigger such as 2500 - 3000 mAh which means it has to be charged often depending on what you are doing, other than that I like it alot"
negative,subjective,I would love to have NFC for Google wallet
negative,subjective,I always accidentally click there instead of where the actual buttons are
positive,subjective,"The screen is nice and crisp, the battery lasts all day"
positive,subjective,I have had no issues in speed or performance
negative,subjective,"I keep my phone on silent 80% of the time so the LED would be a nice addition for me, however, the lack of one does not make the phone any worse and it just a personal preference"
negative,subjective,The only thing that I am not thrilled about are the lack of a notification LED
positive,subjective,I waited to positivet this review until the Kit-Kat update so that I could see if there were any pro's or con's that that brought along
positive,subjective,"Other than that, this is a great device at a great price"
positive,subjective,"Also, the camera is just ok on this compared to some of the other higher end phones"
positive,subjective,I really like that the device comes with a soft case so that I didn't have to buy one
positive,subjective,I just updated the OS to KitKat and everything went very smooth
positive,subjective,3G data speeds seem fast on T-mobile USA network
positive,subjective,GPS works well
positive,subjective,It is a little more narrow that most phones with a 5&#34; screen which I like because it fits my hand better
positive,subjective,I really like the design of the phone
positive,subjective,The Octa-core processing is very quick
positive,objective,"This phone is all I need at a fraction the price of a Samsung galaxy 4, 5 or an I phone"
positive,subjective,The phone is quite nice and does all that I require right now
positive,subjective,Otherwise it's great and HUGE
positive,subjective,I like these phone pretty well it has some audio problems both stream music to the headphone port and bluetooth audio problems
positive,subjective,"I'll update the review if anything changes, but so far, so good"
positive,subjective,The screen size is just right and fits into my palm perfectly
negative,subjective,"Another issue is that the home, back, and list buttons aren't as sensitive as I would like them, and sometimes have to press the sensors multiple times for them to act"
positive,objective,"I've received compliments on it from multiple people and while the orange bar across the bottom is just aesthetic, I like that it sets the phone apart from the other designs in style right now"
positive,subjective,The cameras are clear and the screen is vibrant
positive,objective,The speakers could be &#34;tweaked&#34; for better sound quality
positive,subjective,&#34; I have no issues with apps and downloads
positive,subjective,I usually carry two phones and the dual sim slots are wonderful
positive,subjective,Excellent for the price
positive,subjective,Just be sure to buy a decent sized memory card
positive,subjective,Good value for price and performance
positive,subjective,Other than that the phone works great even the camera surprisingly
positive,subjective,For the price point none of the big phone brands can match it
positive,objective,"A minor problem is that it only has 3G capability, but in all reality it gets the job done"
positive,subjective,The digitizer compliments this by being very accurate and quick to respond to your touch
positive,subjective,BLU's screens are crisp and clear
positive,subjective,The 720p screen is amazing
positive,subjective,The ram is rather quick and efficient
positive,subjective,"Some may say that the 1gb of ram isn't enough, but I haven't had a single problem with this &#34;limitation&#34;"
positive,subjective,I have literary thrown every extreme 3D game at it and it hasn't faltered
positive,subjective,works very  good all counties
positive,subjective,en works fantastic
negative,subjective,Of course no one's gonna take responsability for the warranty so i just lost the money
negative,subjective,You can't watch videos on other websites except YouTube and that is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5
negative,objective,The only problem I really have with this phone is that flash is not supported
positive,subjective,So far the battery life has been more than what I expected
positive,subjective,"So if you want a nicely coloured phone, or a unique phone, and don't care for Bluetooth, this is the phone for you"
positive,subjective,But it is still faster than 3G
positive,subjective,"Does exactly what we want, except Bluetooth and 4G"
negative,subjective,"I was also really bothered by the lack of accessories, specifically cases, because I really want a case with a kickstand and the Blu one doesn't have it"
negative,objective,"Meh things: The phone tends to get really hot with demanding apps or GPS, but it's not noticeable because all that stuff seems to be stuffed at the top of the phone while your hand rests at the bottom"
negative,subjective,This REALLY bothers me because the photos on this phone usually come out blurry
negative,subjective,"Needless to say, this phone demands a lot from the battery and it could be better, but it's not a deal breaker"
negative,subjective,I think battery management is more of a personal thing anyway
negative,objective,Running those demanding benchmarks off charger for about an hour left it at 80%
positive,subjective,"The sound quality is REALLY great from the speaker; that's not something that really interests me, but it was instantly noticeable"
positive,subjective,"It's well built and feels really good, and it's pretty light to boot"
positive,objective,"I bought this phone is significantly cheaper than all three, so I would think it's definitely worth it if you're looking for a cheaper phone to game on"
negative,subjective,Just gets a person used to putting light pressure of a phone screen all around I guess but I believe it should have been built stronger in this reguard
negative,subjective,Even though I am not putting very much pressure on the screen it still blurs like I'm pushing down hard on the screen
negative,subjective,don't plan on doing you coming in if you're trying to get quality pictures with clearNess and no pixelization
positive,subjective,Overall this is a great phone for the price
negative,subjective,I also don't like that it doesn't have the little light that blinks when you have a text so you never really know just by looking at your phone
positive,subjective,For the price I paid this phone is great
negative,objective,Happens every time I store a large video ( more than 45 seconds of video)
positive,objective,"It has no expandable memory and it is so, so light makes it look and feel fake, other than that great phone just got it 5 min ago"
positive,subjective,Would highly recommend to anyone who needs a phone that's fast performing and up-to-date features
negative,subjective,Everything good but the internal memory its just 4 gb
positive,subjective,"Very good camera, works properly, fast, easy to deal with it"
positive,subjective,"So far so good, I like it but just one stuff, it's not 8GB storage , it's only 4 GB memory"

positive,subjective,Good service
positive,subjective,Excellent value for the paid money
positive,subjective,OS is fine
positive,subjective,"Perfect match quality/price , camera is good quality"

positive,subjective,"The screen is clear and bright, and battery life is great"
positive,subjective,"This is a really great phone, especially for the price"
positive,subjective,"This phone is exactly what i expected its neat ,holds in your hand comfortably but the best feature of this phone is it battery life"
negative,objective,Small 8GB internal storage leaving only 3GB for you
positive,subjective,Operation is snappy and it plays all the videos I tried smoothly

positive,subjective,camera quality is good
positive,subjective,Amazon rep was very helpful however; cancelled order and I got free one day shipping
negative,subjective,Camera flash not all that great also
negative,subjective,"Phone is not the white that is depicted, it is more eggshell or off white; which doesn't really matter but it would look better white"
negative,subjective,Has been a little buggy a few times; don't know if it has to do with the phone or the OS
positive,subjective,"Phone has been working well, it is very fast"
positive,subjective,Came as promised - very quickly and my daughter loves it
negative,subjective,We couldn't find how to turn battery saving mode on so the battery ends rather fast
negative,subjective,"Brand new, but a lil too expensive just for this"
positive,subjective,I recommend it if you want a cheap and quality cellphone
positive,subjective,Quality and low price
positive,subjective,"The good news is that with power management app, that can be stretched"
negative,subjective,"The only downside I would point out is the battery, but sounds like its typical of droid phones"
positive,subjective,It powers up within seconds and handles multi-task well
positive,objective,the dual core definitely makes a difference
positive,objective,"1) version of Android (most Android phones on Amazon seem to be running versions from 2 years ago), great screen, great price"
positive,subjective,"Nice build quality, recent (4"
positive,subjective,I have other jelly bean devices for internet so am not really concerned as I bought it as a phone and for that it is good
positive,subjective,"It has a good screen, though I find it too small for my large fingers and strain eyes trying to read such small print"
positive,subjective,"As a phone, it works very well"
positive,objective,Huawei have a website from which you can download detailed instructions
negative,subjective,The review says that it has 4GB of memory but I can only used 1GB for my documents because the other memory is for the system
negative,subjective,I'm not satisfited by the internal memory of this movil
positive,subjective,"At first I was a bit confused because huawei has it's own appstore and there are quite a few Chinese apps in it, but after you get used to it, it is very easy to use"
positive,objective,"Overal I think it is an excellent choice for people who don't use the phone for gaming, looking for moderately priced, stunning looking phone that can provide just about anything that high-end android phones like htc one or S4 offer"
negative,subjective,Low quality (1/5)

positive,subjective,Credit to Amazon's fantastic return policy and process
negative,subjective,"Not sure if my unit was defective as per the GPS module, but I did in fact return it"
negative,subjective,"I know many people love FHD phones, but maybe this device should have had a 720pP display and not the FHD with this GPU"
positive,objective,"No complaints with that, but that GPU is a soar spot"
positive,subjective,"The CPU is by Mediatek and truthfully, they make good processors"
positive,objective,"Now that is not bad for a device with a 720p display or lower, but when you are pushing 440+ PPI, you need a more powerful one"

positive,subjective,It is great because you won't find the case in the market easily that fits this phones
positive,objective,"Comes with some extra stuff, but the case is extremely light thin and fits perfectly"
positive,objective,System wise It has couple of nice features that even my Samsung doesn't have or maybe I didn't see
positive,subjective,"It is fast, very close to my Samsung Galaxy S4 active"
negative,subjective,"So if you are looking for some phone to last for many years, this is not the one for you"
positive,subjective,Functionality wise it seems to be built quite good
positive,subjective,"Its cheap (compared to many other of similar caliber), and you don't mind giving it or selling it or even you damaged it"
negative,subjective,I had to return the first one from the buyer I purchased because there were some black dots (2-3) so I thought was the pixels issues

positive,subjective,-Stock android - ROM manager doesn't seem to recognize the BLU LIFE PURE and I'm concerned about the few locations where custom ROMs are available - BLU has stated that KitKat will be available shortly but that would a couple months ago
positive,subjective,-gorilla glass or equivalent - as large as these displays are getting it's only a matter of time before a crack or drop happens

positive,subjective,5&#34; display - this device has made me a convert to larger than 4

negative,subjective,The limitations listed above that caused this device to receive 4/5 stars are pretty much known things going in to this purchase or could be worked out with some work and downloading - the battery (capacity or not being replaceable) is probably it's biggest most fatal flaw
positive,subjective,As stated before what can you really expect out of a phone at this price point
positive,subjective,or so  and indoors you'll probably be taking some blurry anything but sharp shots

positive,objective,Problem solved with a couple free EQ apps on the marketplace
negative,subjective,5mm jack is very &#34;flat&#34; and has little dynamic range - coming from an iPhone (which is really an iPod with a phone when it first was introduced) I didn't realize how spoiled I was with the built in EQ
positive,subjective,In my opinion I would gladly give up a millimeter or 3 for a larger battery or even better a replaceable one
positive,subjective,I'm on AT&T; and get pretty decent speeds with a Samsung Note 3 and Apple iPhone 5s - those are both top tier smartphones that would cost twice as much as the LIFE PURE off contract - the second reason is that in most places I'll be using this device I have access to WiFi

negative,subjective,I am eagerly awaiting Blu's seemingly forever away upgrade to Kitkat
positive,objective,"Phone is a little flimsy (corners dent easily),  but light enough to prevent major damage when dropped 1-3 ft"
positive,subjective,On semi/heavy use battery runs down easily
positive,subjective,Phone gets hot too easy didn't realize until I took off my hard case
positive,subjective,"The phone performs pretty good, speed is good, camera is A grade, wonderful graffics, move thru the app trays pretty smoothly"

positive,subjective,"This is a very good mid-range cell phone for a good price, I suppose that the Moto G 2014 version must be much better, but if you don&#8217;t have enough money, this is a very good decision"

positive,subjective,Size is just right for me
negative,subjective,My biggest complaint (and the weakest part of the phone) would be the camera
positive,subjective,For the price this is a hell of a great cellphone
positive,subjective,Good price and good quality are its strong characteristic
positive,subjective,No promised updates even though BLU is pretty good about device support down the road
positive,objective,"One is a dual SIM notification, and the other is a persistent battery notification that always let's you know where you stand on battery life"
positive,objective,Battery life - I'm sure that the 720p display contributes to the longevity of the phone's battery
positive,subjective,The camera is the basic stock Android app and simplistic
positive,subjective,"I was concerned about picture quality with only an 8MP camera, again, I was pleasantly surprised by the images this thing takes"
positive,subjective,"I'm not using that feature, but it does look like it could be very useful"
positive,subjective,The screen is bright and easy on the eyes
positive,objective,"About that 720p display - while that resolution might sounds low given today's qHD and 1080p phone screens, it is surprisingly good"

positive,subjective,"At this price point, this is a very well designed phone"

negative,subjective,Battery life in real life is a little less than the Moto G
positive,objective,"You need the STANDARD size sim card, not the micro that is pretty common"
positive,objective,Blu has dual sims
positive,subjective,"A nice touch on the Blu, the charging cord and cord for earbuds are flat, which means they tangle less"

positive ,objective,"If you're looking for a good, well designed smartphone but don't want to spend over two hundred dollars, I'd recommend this one"

negative,objective,"2) The power cord is on the top of the phone (minor complaint, yes, but it's a bit awkward)"

positive,subjective,"1) The display is very responsive, quick, and vibrant - much better than my Nexus and my old Ipod touch"

negative ,objective,"It does not connect to 4G, but otherwise it is an awesome phone"
positive,subjective,Amazing phone for the money
positive,objective,Comes with a silicon case to boot
positive,subjective,This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price
positive ,objective,And hi-def video camera
positive,objective,"That is the joy of unlocked phones, and it's hard to justify buying a 600 buck flagship phone and paying 500 bucks a year for it and then having it be a useless brick (leaking chemicals in the town dump) if you want another carrier when phones like this are out there for 1/4 the price, plus unlimited consumer choice"
positive,objective,"And the very best thing to me is being able to drop most any firm's sim card into it and whammo, suddenly everything is ready to go"
positive,objective,I for one am still astonished by all this stuff for this little money

positive,subjective,"I have with this phone so far, and it doesn't show fingerprints and the screen looks just fine to me through it"
positive,subjective,"The price of this thing is surely the selling point, and with a camera this good and so many other user-friendly features for online use, that price seems quite amazing"
positive,objective,"The pluses are many, mainly that you get a ton of features with a crisp 5"" screen for 150"
negative,subjective,"And I guess another negative is that this is pretty darn big for a phone; you'll need a purse for this, or a big cargo pocket"
positive,subjective,"But then again, there's not a whole lot of space for better speakers in a phone this thin"
negative,subjective,"The last negative is the sound, pretty weak"
positive,objective,"But it does come with a usb charger that goes straight into 120 AC, so that's a nice bonus that makes charging anywhere very easy"
negative,subjective,"The other main negative is the very short battery life, barely enough to get through the day if you use the computer aspects/games etc much"
negative ,objective,"Other times, it sets Avast off, thinking I have removed the SIM card because the second card is not present"
negative,objective,My phone's back camera now has a small hairline crack

positive,subjective,It also uses less battery than LTE
positive,objective,"4 in the same location, but the point is, its useable"
positive,subjective,3G/HSPA+ Its quite fast
positive,subjective,"BUILD QUALITY- The device is built quite well, and does not feel cheap (With the case on) I asked a friend how much he thought it cost, and he guessed $550"
positive,objective,"The front camera is useable, at least for Skype and selfies"
negative,objective,"Quite frankly, the back camera is pretty bad for 5 megapixels and autofocus"
positive,objective,"I tested wired external speakers and headphones, and it had really good sound quality (It even supports a 5"
positive,subjective,"It works well on speakerphone, but wear headphones or use external/Bluetooth speakers for music"

positive,subjective,"3 Ghz quad core processor is no slouch, either"

positive,subjective,SPEED:  This phone is FAST
negative,objective,"However, a 5 inch screen I feel is just a little bit too big to use with one hand than 4"

positive,objective,Big ups for using flat wiring for the headphones and the included USB cable to prevent tangling
positive,objective,The phone also comes with decent in-ear headphones
positive,subjective,"I'd argue this is just as good as a Moto G, barring a few things here and there, such as onboard storage being limited to 4GB on this phone, no HD LTE version, and no gorilla glass or water proofing"
positive,subjective,"The screen is solid, the speaker gets super loud without sounding distorted, and the overall Google experience on this phone is really snappy"
positive,subjective,"The build quality is a lot better than I expected it to be considering the price point, and as such, it feels great in hand"

positive,subjective,"Video looks great on this phone, and I didn't experience any lagging while watching it (using my local wi-fi network)"
positive,objective,"There is also a high capacity (up to 32GB) micro SD slot, so I can store all of my music and/or photos on that, instead of streaming or using up data accessing stuff in the cloud"
positive,objective,"I could set it up with a work number and a home number, or get creative and use a low-cost service for voice in one SIM and a data service like Red Pocket where I can just buy a GB of data at a time in the other SIM, making it more economical"

positive,objective,"Oh, and did I mention that this camera comes with a case and a screen protector"
positive,objective,"The phone also has a dual Sim card thingy that I don't quite understand (or likely need), but the rep at the phone store helping me today was a bit surprised to see that option"
positive,subjective,I was also able to get pics from my Kindle Fire cloud folder onto the phone's cloud folder with little trouble

positive,objective,"If your not a &#34;Hardcore gamer power media consuming mobile user&#34; and simply need a device that makes phone calls, texts, take a few pics &amp; runs most all apps smoothly, this Blu Studio 5"

negative,subjective,"call the company blu and told me that the problem was windows, call windows and did not give me a solution, but I think the problem is the 2 because the phone when it detects that the SIM card does not have that option should block for failing then search in that sim"

negative ,objective,The phone is nice but the build and quality is ZERO
negative,objective,"Cheap screen, had the protective cover on, had the phone for only 2 hours, went to place it on table and the screen cracked"

negative,objective,I have other BLU phones (different model) that connect to the bluetooth devices that this phone is having problems with

negative,objective,"It looks like when you put a screen protector on and it looks a little wet, but it's underneath the outer layer of plastic but above the LCD"
negative,objective,"Then, in the center of the screen, when it is off, you can see the layers of film sticking together"
negative,objective,"The screen itself under the plastic overlay (no, I don't mean the screen protector, which I haven't attached yet) is a milky/hazy color"
negative,objective,On the left side of the screen it looks deformed as if it's compressed
negative,objective,"In all four corners of the screen there is, what appears to be, water droplets"

negative,objective,"The only way to get it to work again was to remove the battery and wait for it to ""reboot"""
negative,objective,"The phone would not respond to any commands, touch and hard buttons"
negative,objective,"After only three days, yes just three days later, it began to malfunction and froze numerous times"

negative,objective,The phone hardware broke after 2 hrs of operation
negative,subjective,Also when I complained about their poor customer service they didn't even bother to respond to that email and have not even said anything that makes me think they remotely care about their 'valued' customers
negative,objective,While I still like their product I'm never buying from them again because I'd hate to deal with their customer service ever again and paying for a month of phone service that I COULD not use irritated me beyond this
negative ,objective,Beyond that I had to keep emailing them because they never gave me any information and then they told me they where shipping the phone soon and would send tracking information I emailed them at the end of that week and did not get a response for ANOTHER week after which time I had already received the replacement phone
negative,objective,I had to send the phone in for repair and just for them to get me the RMA so I could send it back took a week then I had to PAY to ship it to them and wait nearly 3 weeks to get it back
negative,objective,I've gone for 2 days and the phone would not come on
negative,objective,"I used only two days and then lost the signals, pls return the money"
positive,objective,"I'm still within my warranty period, just thought it was a good price for the same features as a Galaxy"
negative,subjective,"I have been trying without success to get the manufacture to replace but so far, it's like pulling teeth I'm just getting the run around, like asking me for my address which is clearly on my receipt"

negative,objective,"Contacts are the same way and there is no contacts option on the screen, editing contacts is blinding with the same faint gray on white"
negative,objective,Only a couple of texts (from the carrier only) have gone through and the fields are a plain white background with very small pale gray type
negative,objective,"I like appealing graphics, in addition to being useless, this phone is very colorlessly dull on graphics"
negative,objective,Frustrating pain in the caboose to navigate
negative,objective,Despite having data disabled it eats data voraciously
negative,objective,"We've contacted the carrier, Motorola, we've taken it to RadioShack to ask the kind souls there for help and so far no one has been able to get text set up to look or work anywhere near any other ""smart""phone"
negative,objective,Countless fruitless calls to a call center and I cannot text contacts from this phone
negative,subjective,"I would consider unlocked Nokia, it's more durable and even cheaper"
negative,subjective,I don't think it's worth the price
negative,objective,And one day it just fails completely
negative,objective,"The battery is failing all the time, and it takes a century to recharge"
negative,subjective,I hope its more prompt reply to solve this problem
negative,objective,"receiving sending me I could tell that the phone box was not sealed, had been raped and was missing the charger and audofonos"

negative,objective,"Dumped cache, reset to factory settings as Motorola request"
negative,objective,This is a well know product defect after Jan 2014 software upgrade
negative,objective,Major problems with &#34;No Sim Card&#34; errors
negative,subjective,I just lost 2 hundreds dollar because my stupid decision of buying this piece of crap
negative,objective,;  I will never buy another Motorola product solely due to the poor customer service
negative,subjective,I am returning the phone and will buy a different brand (Samsung) directly from AT&amp;T
negative,objective,We called Motorola Technical Support directly and they were absolutely no help
negative,objective,;  AT&T; could not get the phone to work with their system
negative,objective,I got this phone and had to return it the same day as the screen randomly kept unresponsive
negative,subjective,"Although this phone is great, the SD card cuts my service 3-4 times a day and I wish I could have gotten something or a seller that was more reliable"
negative,objective,There is no button to contact him or her
negative,objective,The seller is also impossible to reach
negative,subjective,Now I am a disappointed customer who wishes that the return policy was longer or that they made exceptions
negative,subjective,I tried to return the phone but was too late because of it's one month return policy
negative,subjective,"It doesn't matter what I do, even if I leave it on the counter all day, it still dislocates itself"
negative,objective,"Just today, I had to open my phone up and reset the SD card four times"
negative,objective,"Then after about three weeks, the SD card began dislocating itself"
negative,objective,A whole lot of people have reported this issue of battery going completely dead
negative,objective,"I tried hard reset, and all other tricks suggested on the web"
negative,objective,The phone is completely dead
negative,objective,"Then, one fine day, I left it overnight without charging"
negative,objective,"There is no obvious physical damage to explain this, and its not the result of water exposure"
negative,objective,"However, today the phone just stopped working for no reason"
positive,objective,The device worked as expected and I was pretty happy with device given its performance for the price
negative,objective,It just shut off
negative,objective,It won't even turn on
negative,subjective,It worked fine up until now
positive,subjective,The camera was awesome and took spectacular pics
positive,subjective,The battery life was pretty good
negative,objective,This is the last time I purchase a windows/google phone with a non-removable battery
negative,objective,Motorola support couldn't even help
negative,objective,"After plugging it in the wall after a few hours i tried turning it back on, it started to reboot and then gave me a blue screen and would not come on since"
negative,objective,It shut off while i was using it and would not turn back on
negative,objective,"On the other hand, I had to buy a charger because the specifications of the phone does not say that NO brings charger"
negative,objective,"Stay away from this phone until this bug is fixed your alarm will not wake you up, it can drop dead in your pocket and you would not know it and some people said the phone did not turn again"
negative,objective,According to Motorola it is a software problem but who knows if they don't lie
negative,objective,"Motorola knows that the phone goes from 100% to 0% in a second, they acknowledge the problem but they did not fix it for several months now"
negative,objective,"the phone is not in good condition, looks used"
negative,objective,The charger (USB cord) supplied with phone simple wont charge the same
negative,objective,Just put it on wifi
negative,subjective,And mind you I am yet to put my sim into the same
negative,objective,But real problem started after it went to low battery level
negative,subjective,Love the phone but when making calls there was a  Popping Sound on both the phone I received so I return them both
negative,objective,"When I called again and again they listed various reasons for not having sent it, from a communication confusion, to being out of stock of their own phone"
negative,objective,"They have told me this three times, and each time they have not sent it"
negative,objective,"Because it was still under warranty, and a result of &#34;faulty hardware&#34; they told me to send it to a Motorola facility and they would have it fixed in 5-8 business days"
negative,objective,Then one day the touch screen spontaneously stopped working
negative,objective,That happens several times a day
negative,objective,"I would not recommend this product to anyone unless there is a known fixed or patch for this issue, which is highly unlikely given the fact that it's been over 5 months they've known about this issue"
negative,objective,S that is not entirely necessary and ruined a perfectly fine hardware capable of many great things at a reasonable price
negative,objective,I am quite disappointed with Motorola and their ability to solve issues with their products in the reasonable amount of time
negative,objective,Still there hasn't been any patch or known solutions
negative,objective,I've done factory resets several times and according to other users on forums this problem been known by Motorola since January and it is May now
negative,objective,"You can look up all the problems this phone has regarding loosing signal, auto toggle airplane mode and no-sim symbol coming on randomly"
negative,objective,It was working great until I got push notification telling me to upgrade to Android version 4
negative,objective,I wanted to return this but Amazon doesn't allow once 15 days are passed
negative,objective,"Sometimes even on max volume, person on the other side of the call is hardly audible"
negative,subjective,"In addition, sounds buttons don't work perfectly"
negative,objective,Also all icons sometimes displayed in black squares
negative,objective,Keyboard of this phone simply hangs sometime
negative,subjective,I could't return because I was out of US
negative,objective,After few days traveling the screen stop working without any damage (Hardware issues)
negative,objective,I have tried all the options given to me to try and rectify this problem but NOTHING worked for me
negative,subjective,I regret buying this phone and will not recommend it to anyone as I have learnt through my own frustrations that many other customers experience this very problem
negative,objective,If it does connect by any miracle it will stay connected if I am am close to the router as soon as I move just one foot away the connecting is gone
negative,objective,iIt now cannot easily connect to any available wifi open connection
negative,objective,So my anger is not with the phone itself but with Verizon's monopoly
negative,objective,Apparently both Verizon &amp; Sprint do NOT allow any unlocked phones to be used on their network unless it's their own unlocked phone
negative,objective,"I bought this &#34;unlocked&#34; phone for my existing Verizon contract and although there is nothing wrong with the phone itself, I am extremely disappointed"
negative,objective,I understand that this is considered a &#34;value smartphone&#34; but I don't think it is worth any amount of money if it is completely useless after letting the battery die
negative,subjective,I have tried many different possible solutions to this problem but unfortunately I'm afraid my phone is bricked
negative,objective,"After using for around a month now, I finally let my battery completely drain to 0% (to the point where it shut off) and it simply will not charge again"
negative,objective,Your best bet is to basically not let it die completely
negative,objective,so if it has died completely it doesn't charge and cannot come back on
negative,objective,"I was told it was a problem with the system, the phone is basically wired to not charge unless it is on"
negative,objective,"The first time the phone did eventually come on after 3 days of battling with it, charging and removing the charger, pressing the power button again and again"
negative,subjective,You can imagine how much of a hassle and inconvenience this is as a student or even a working professional
positive,objective,"When the first phone had this issue, Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement free of charge"
negative,objective,"The 3 times this has happened, the phone will not charge, will not turn on, and the battery is not removable so there's really nothing you can do about it until it decides to turn on"
negative,objective,"Basically, sometimes I accidentally let my battery die out to the point where it shuts off completely"
negative,objective,"It does not have a replaceable battery so that option is out,  It was supposed to be good as new, well that's not so"
negative,objective,"He turned it off, plugged it in to charge over night and then NOTHING"
negative,objective,He just started to get used to it and then it stops working
negative,objective,"When you make a purchase that costs more than a day's wages you would expect some longevity out of it, at least I do,  This phone didn't even work for 5 months"
negative,objective,What a waste of money and time trying to figure out how to fix it
negative,objective,For anyone wanting  to buy this phone please check out the mms problems online before you give them $200
negative,subjective,Now of course upon my return to America four weeks later I find I am stuck with this brand new phone that won't charge
negative,objective,When I plugged the device in it wouldn't charge
negative,objective,"This happens to be an unfair marketing practice / strategy, (not sure by either Amazon or by Motorola), as the above important facts about the product are not been disclosed"
negative,objective,4) No earphones included
negative,objective,an uneven odd mix that gives an impression if its an OEM product purchased separately in bits and bolts
negative,objective,3) White color USB cable for a Black colored phone
negative,objective,2) It does not comes with any type of a charger or what so ever other than just a USB cable
negative,objective,I can't return it and I don't have the option to file a complaint with amazon
negative,objective,"I want a new one, this is not fair, I was all excited and now I have this brand new damaged phone I threw my money to the garbage with this purchase and I don't know what to do"
negative,objective,"This is horrible, more than 30 days have passed because I am in Venezuela and it took long to arrive and the return policy does not apply for me anymore"
negative,objective,It launches apps randomly and types whatever letter it's crazy
negative,objective,This phone's touch screen came damaged
negative,objective,Returned to Amazon for a refund
negative,objective,Phone would not turn on after less than a month
negative,objective,Aside from the mms issue this is a great phone but being unable to get our receive photos is a real pain
negative,objective,Motorola offers no substantive support I have sent two emails they respond telling me I will get an answer within 24 hours and a week later nothing
negative,objective,Moto G does not recieve MMS group text or any multi media text
negative,objective,"Came incomplete and looks used, lacked headset and stuff"
negative,subjective,"So i am screwed,i am stuck with that phone stuck on the bootloader screen with no options working"
negative,objective,Motorola will not accept to repair the phone if you do not have  a US adress
negative,objective,"Beware for people that does not live in the United States ,You will not have any warranty if you buy on amazon"
negative,objective,"""Hi Michael, this is john from tmobile we were not able to find any documents that we can send you since they are internal documents please go to tmobile store and we will more than happy to show you our  Data Device Band Capabilities"""
negative,objective,Useless update from T-Mobile tech support --
negative,objective,So here is the long winded story -- T-Mobile only supports an LTE frequency called U1900
negative,objective,I can not even play music with it
negative,objective,I missed a lot of call and did not notice that the speaker not works
negative,objective,"the speaker stops working today, after only 5 moth"
negative,objective,"Well, I certainly miss my iPhone days at this point and am ready to sign my soul to the devil for a 5C because this aggravation is not worth the low price"
negative,subjective,"Additionally, I am having even WORSE issues viewing videos on youtube and other sites"
negative,subjective,"I just got a new router and every hunk of metal in this house is hooking up to the wifi just fine, but little homie Moto G keeps giving me authentication problems"
negative,objective,"2, was causing connectivity issues with Moto G: which would explain (maybe) why chromecasting google play would stop randomly, or why Plex was constantly disconnecting, or why I would have to refresh a youtube video 10 times to view it"
negative,objective,Nothing going on there
negative,objective,Need to double check a text or maps while on a call
negative,objective,I have seen this discussed in other reviews: unreliable screen flickering during calls
negative,objective,It left me miserably lost late one night when I was not double-checking each goshdarn instruction
negative,objective,"It will let you *choose* which route you'd like to take, and then turn-by-turn directions will send you on another"
negative,objective,It will point out the most ridiculous routes
negative,objective,"I depend on GPS to visit friends and family across the state (Florida) and my God, it will tell me to make a U-turn to go straight"
positive,subjective,It's supposed to be user-friendly
negative,objective,It said it did work but I am not shown any extra space yet
negative,objective,my preference is for an SD card slot which gives me memory space ALWAYS available
negative,objective,It has been replaced with a free 50GB of Google Drive space for 2 years
negative,objective,I am returning mine to Amazon for a refund
negative,objective,I have spoken twice with the technical support team at Motorola who have been very polite but unable to resolve the problems with the phone
negative,objective,It locks up and I cannot navigate from one function to another
negative,objective,What an idiot would make a phone without supporting Chinese language
negative,objective,"Forums on the web have reported that it has been addressed with a firmware update, however, none of the updates have addressed the problem"
negative,objective,But it repeatedly loses connection with the SIM card and becomes inoperable
negative,objective,This phone will not maintain a good connection with the SIM card and therefore loses all connection to a network
negative,objective,"After all attemps had failed, I had the phone checked at a cellphone tech place where they concluded there had to be something wrong with the phone's battery (which is &#34;not user friendly&#34;, had only been turned on once, not designed for users to remove themselves and ALSO not for sale in my country)"
negative,objective,I woke up to a device that I could not turn on no matter how many times I pressed the &#34;Power Button&#34; or how many hours it spend plugged into a PC
positive,objective,"The evening progressed fine and the device seemed to deliver every promise made by the companies who designed, manufactured, sponsored and sold the product; and so, I turned it off and went to sleep"
negative,objective,"The package arrived as soon as the website said it would, to start a slow process of burocratic paperwork in the hands of the LibertyExpress people (who I MUST add delivered the package to me in splendid conditions and PERFECTLY sealed)"
negative,objective,I ordered this product on april but did not recieve it until yesterday because I live in Venezuela and had to use an international mailing/locker company called Liberty Express
negative,subjective,Not worth the money I spent on it
negative,objective,"I don't need or want a handheld game system, I need a phone, and if I can't get a signal then this just occupies space"
negative,objective,That makes this completely useless
negative,objective,But my Moto G sitting next to my work phone has zero bars
negative,objective,I'm sitting in my home and no signal
negative,objective,"But the worst thing, the reason I give this phone only 1 star is that I cannot get a signal"
positive,objective,The camera is okay at best
positive,subjective,The screen is nice and it appears to be a fairly durable phone
negative,objective,Black line going across screen
negative,objective,My Moto G Suddenly has a thin black line on my screen
negative,objective,"The &#34;on&#34; led turns on when i connect the charger, but the screen has never turn on again"
negative,objective,I was using the web browser and suddenly the screen goes black
negative,objective,"There's a problem with the screen, it shows nothing"
negative,objective,The mobile only work for less than a month
negative,objective,They have not responded to my email or phone calls
negative,subjective,Even worse was the Motorola customer support
negative,objective,The unit did not work on arrival
negative,objective,"The SD card issue is a no deal for me, especially with the only 5-6GB of available built-in storage"
positive,subjective,"Otherwise, the Moto G is a fantastic phone for the money"
negative,objective,"It would not mount a Samsung Evo 32GB Class 10 card, reporting that the card was damaged and blank (though it worked fine on my PC and had music files on it)"
negative,objective,"Mine, among others, was plagued by SD card slot issues"
negative,objective,I hope i can return it before i decide to beat it to death with a big hammer
negative,objective,This phone is a bigger piece of crap than the one i flushed down the stool this morning
negative,objective,"defective phone, the battery of the device can not be loaded, telefono defectuoso la bateria no es cargada por el telefono"
negative,objective,"It's also worth noting that the device doesn't appear to support the bands used by Sprint's network, which makes its 'Universal' claim, even more dubious"
negative,objective,"LTE bands 2, 4, 5 and 17 are mostly used within the United States of America and see extremely limited use anywhere else"
negative,objective,"The reason for my rather harsh rating is that the device purports to be a 'Universal 4G LTE' device, while it is most assuredly not 'Universal'"
positive,subjective,"Honestly, the device is mostly fine"
negative,objective,Twice I was sent 2 locked phones when I bought an UNLOCKED one
negative,objective,"From my browsings online, I discovered that Motorola is aware of this SD card issue and will be addressing it in the latest Kit Kat update for the Moto G 4G"
negative,objective,"I would have been better off with the normal Moto G, which much to my chagrin, is also cheaper"
negative,objective,"Since this &#34;freezing&#34; can happen at anytime, it makes the SD card on this phone useless to me"
negative,subjective,I am actually looking at my phone right now as its battery indicator turns red
negative,objective,The phone's battery has to die before a restart can be done because of the freeze up
negative,objective,In this state trying to power the phone off to restart is useless
negative,objective,I read online that this may be the SD card unmounting on its own
negative,objective,but at seemingly random times the SD card seemed to &#34;freeze&#34; causing any applications trying to access the card to also freeze
positive,subjective,Media read much faster
negative,objective,"When using this card in the Moto G 4G, I found that reading data off the card was noticeably sluggish"
negative,objective,Motorola may also disappeare from Europe because of patent violations
negative,objective,"I tried to get the original battery from all the local cell phone specialists, but I learned that Motorola simply disappeared from the local market"
negative,objective,"I reported to Motorola, I got their reply that they would contact me within 24h, but they did not follow up since 2624h"
negative,objective,"Charging, the phone screen displayed the warning about the wrong battery and it did not charge"
negative,objective,I got for free from Loxley a new battery which is not the original battery
negative,objective,"The battery is defective, but Loxley explained to me they do not have spare parts from Motorola"
negative,subjective,Overheated poor quity
negative,objective,"I have been trying to charge it and nothing seems to change, the device does not work"
negative,objective,"However, a week ago it suddenly switch off and it did not worked again"
positive,subjective,The first two weeks that I used the cellphone it works perfectly
negative,objective,The phone broke down within 3 weeks
negative,objective,"Motorola said it would not fix it since it's damaged by water, although it was never in the water since she got it"
negative,objective,I have had this phone for 4 months and it was left when my kid left for camp and it died and now it will not charge at all
negative,objective,It unmounts after about 2 minutes of downloading data
negative,objective,There is a compatibility issue with some or all SD cards and this phone
negative,objective,Saving a few bucks is costing me dearly in time and energy
negative,objective,) the standby battery only lasts 4 days and change
negative,objective,"Even when I turn off the apps (WiFi, Data, updates, etc"
negative,subjective,The battery life is not acceptable
positive,subjective,"I returned it and (bit the bullet) and ordered directly from Consumer Cellular (same phone, more money) and it works just fine"
positive,objective,(The SIM worked in my CC phone just fine
negative,objective,The phone didn't recognize the SIM CC had sent me
negative,objective,I made sure that I ordered the correct configuration for use with CC
negative,objective,Customers have been complaining for months and there is still no fix
negative,objective,Micro SD Card doesn't work
negative,subjective,I am so disappointed and I hope to receive some assistance with a representative concerning this issue
negative,objective,I've waited the whole day hoping it would turn back on for no reason just as it died for no reason
negative,objective,"It has battery, it was charging over 50% when I lost the signal"
negative,objective,"I turned it off and when I tried to turn it back on, it doesn't do anything"
negative,objective,It all began with the no signal sign so I decided to reboot it
positive,objective,"I waited and purchased the Motorola Moto G LTE on June 8th, I have to say that it is very economical"
negative,objective,has European frequences and will not work
negative,objective,Its says unlocked in the description but when my girls took it to MetroPCS to get activated they say its not unlocked
positive,objective,"HSPA+ still works, however"
negative,objective,The 'Universal' LTE claim here is very misleading
negative,objective,It happens when im writing something or anything even when im playing a game
negative,objective,It turns on normally it doesn't have no scratches but the touch screen stop working and I cant do anything about it but to turn it off and re-started againg
negative,subjective,"In my opinion, this phone should be withdrawn from sale until this problem is resolved"
negative,objective,"Turning wifi off and back on in settings would usually get wifi working again for awhile but, usually, not for long"
negative,objective,"Tier 2 support acknowledged that there is a problem with wifi on this phone but could offer no solution other than replace the phone (which I did, through Amazon -- same problem)"
negative,objective,The hour and a half that I spent on the phone with Motorola support was fruitless
positive,objective,"Easy usage, simple usage"
negative,objective,Will not take a charge
negative,objective,Battery died after 5 months of usage
negative,objective,"i have a trouble with my smartphone, it heated and after appears a blue line in the superior border when it has a white fund"

negative,objective,Called TMobile and I was sent a new SIM card
negative,objective,I have to turn off phone and resets SIM card in order to get back in service
negative,objective,This happens at least once or twice a week
negative,objective,Signed up with TMobile service using this phone but it won't recognize micro SIM card intermittently
negative,objective,to break selectively the microphone
positive,objective,The rest of the telephone is working perfectly so I could not do anything wrong
negative,objective,so there is a failure with the microphone
positive ,subjective,When I use headphones they can listen to me perfectly
negative,subjective,"Glass is smooth, but underneath the display looks cracked"
negative,objective,Pulled it out of my front pocket this evening when the phone rang and the screen looks broke
positive,objective,Worked great for one month
negative,subjective,I'm very disappointed because I have no phone service and I have to invest in a new phone again
negative,objective,I charged it repeatedly and still cannot get power

negative,objective,Nothing fixes the issue
negative,objective,Power off and on
negative,objective,In the last one week I have tried doing factory reset several times
negative,objective,After that it seemed like the issue got fixed as the phone did not drop connection
negative,objective,2 update  onwards many are having such problems
negative,subjective,Horrible quality

negative,objective,"Then, after the new system update, it became useless"
negative,objective,"The second phone, the replacement, worked perfectly for an hour"
negative,objective,The first phone that arrived wouldn't read my SIM card no matter what I tried
negative,objective,"I can not change it because I take you to another country, they are very bad inrresponsable sold items"
negative,objective,this phone does not work amazon sold me bad
negative,subjective,Clearly it seems they're selling refurbished phones at new phone prices
negative,objective,"Six weeks later the new one has stopped working; approxmately six ""reboot"" messages appeared on the screen and within 12 hours the phone was no longer charging and then it stopped working"
negative,objective,"However within two weeks of use the phone started giving problems, the screen went purple and started shutting down on its own"
negative,subjective,If it is possible I will like to turn back the clock and never bought this phone
negative,objective,Also why is so many people having this problem and there is nothing Motorola can do about it
negative,subjective,Which got me thinking I paid full price for a new phone but I'm getting a refurbished phone back
negative,objective,I also contacted the motorola for a replacement phone only to find out the replacement phone is a refurbished phone
negative,objective,I have been charging for more than 6-8 hrs on and off
negative,objective,"Originally I have no led notification light at all, now I have a solid led light when I plug into wall charger"
negative,objective,I tried all the tricks but it does not work
negative,objective,"The phone went dead a few time but finally this time it went completely dead (btw I charged my phone everyday, the battery never went down below 20%)"

negative,objective,I like the phone itself but I cant use it because of the battery issue
negative,objective,NEVER let the battery die completely and yet I'm having the same problem that MANY other users are having--THE BATTERY WON'T RECHARGE
negative,objective,Motorola support has been unable to solve the problems
negative,objective,Errors appear
negative,objective,The Motorola phone I not open applications
negative,objective,I am unable to remove and replace the battery as the battery is embedded to the back of the phone
negative,objective,This problem persist and now the battery is not taking any charge and as such the phone can no longer be used

negative,objective,Phone restores Tmob APNs
negative,subjective,Not LTE capable
negative,objective,I choose different cell phone and paid the difference today and this time I purchased the 2 years warranty/protection plan
negative,objective,It was already past 30 days after we purchased it but Sears was kind enough to replace it just this once
negative,objective,I did not buy a warranty at the time of purchase since we never had problems with any cell phones before
negative,objective,I tried all the tricks by charging it and pressing the on/off button for few minutes to no avail
negative,objective,It still had battery but it completely died and it would not charge
negative,objective,"It completely died 2 months later, 9/17/14"
positive,subjective,"I've seen some lagging when gaming and the camera is OK, but I am giving 5 stars to this phone because of its superior cost-value"
positive,objective,"yeah, 2 days on a smartphone at least"
positive,objective,"The battery life is definitely something else, I've been using the phone ""heavy duty"" since the first day I received it and the battery lasts at least 1"
positive,subjective,Super fast
positive,subjective,I'm using it with AT&T; GoPhone and the LTE works like WOW
negative,objective,"The screen is crisp and the phone itself is just the right size, a little bigger than the iPhone 5 it is replacing"
positive,subjective,"This phone is just amazing, can't believe it's just 200 bucks"
negative,objective,LED notification turns on when connected to USB port of wall outlet but not waking up
negative,objective,it had been turning off randomly during the last few days and yesterday it finally died for good
negative,objective,"12/22: Phone died yesterday after 3 months, changing my rate from 5 to 1 star"
negative,objective,"If it was not for the SIM issue, I would probably rate the phone 4 stars"
negative,objective,"Once of the main reasons I bought these was because Otterbox makes a Defender series case for this, which is great - but taking the phone out of the case multiple times per day to re-insert the SIM is a pain"
negative,subjective,"It is so frustrating, because I am trying to reach people, and the phone is off the network"
negative,objective,"I've had all the SIMS replaced, the phones replaced, and put every firmware upgrade available"
negative,objective,"Turning the phone off and on does not remedy it, only taking the SIM out and re-inserting it"
negative,objective,"What I mean by that, is that several times a day, the phone says that there is no SIM"
negative,objective,The issue I am having on all the phones is that I keep losing the SIM
negative,objective,Work good for few months and then Battery issue start
negative,objective,"No lights, it is the second time it happens, but not with this model and is the second time sent me a defective phone"
negative,subjective,"good afternoon, pleasure to greet, the phone came damaged"
negative,objective,"I buy a MOTO G (8GB) when i received  this cellphone, constantly restarts until finally not turn on any more, so i expected the seller will can solve me this problem"

negative,objective,"The cellphone has a little scratch next to the microphone, and it was completely unloaded"
negative,objective,not booting after lot's of effort
negative,objective,battery not coming up
negative,objective,"Do phone after one month stopped working, the screen was black with white stripes, and that did not have any fall, would like to know if you sent me the replacement since it was a mistake of the phone itself, or I have to buy the spare"
negative,objective,Not universal with Verizon post-paid in the United States
negative,objective,"Good evening, I received the package, but it was not what I expected, eltelefonocelular wine without mains charger and accessories"
negative,objective,"When I went to activate the 'G' I was told it could not transfer my old data from the DNA, because it wasn't a Moto 'X' model (instead of  'G')"
negative,subjective,"I am still hoping for a resolution, but have pretty much given up on Motorola's product and tech support"
negative,objective,"After not receiving the phone, I called only to find that it was never shipped and that they didn't have it in stock or know when it would be available for shipment"
positive,subjective,Luckily Amazon refunded her money
negative,objective,"After hours on the phone with Motorola, my wife gave up and went with a new phone"
negative,objective,From what I have read it is either a defective battery or motherboard
negative,objective,"After the battery gets to a certain low charge, it locks up and will not accept a charge and the phone is bricked"
negative,objective,After doing a Google search for &#34;moto g will not charge or power up&#34; I found that a ton of people are having this issue with the phone
negative,objective,They both locked up and would not accept a charge/power off/etc
negative,objective,"Hers lasted less than 30 days, and mine lasted less than 90 days"
negative,objective,Either Pandora or Google Maps crashes
negative,subjective,"For example, using Google maps while streaming Pandora through Bluetooth is very unstable"
negative,subjective,Initially I liked the device but I returned it since my favorite apps kept on crashing
negative,objective,Then you will see just how much time you will be wasting trying to fix this phone
negative,objective,"Just run a search using key words: Moto G, signal drop, isuues"
negative,objective,I will not post all the links discussing all the problems with this phone which Motorola has not figured out how to fix since kitkat4
negative,objective,"We rest the partition, erased all memory within the partition, and now the final one, wipe the phone clean and start over with a complete factory reset"
negative,objective,To date Motorola has refused to do a new phone for the phone I bought and I still have the problem after three attempts by motorola tech support to fix it
negative,objective,The phone came to me broken and unable to keep signal
negative,objective,I told them I bought it brand new I should get a brand new one to replace it
negative,objective,Still they cannot fix the problems and want me to take a rebuilt phone to replace the brand new one
negative,objective,4 then Motorola changed its tune
negative,objective,But once all the stuff came out on the internet about this phone having nothing but problems due to bugs in the kitkat 4
negative,subjective,I have been dealing with all the problems from losing signal after every call to losing internet randomly
negative,objective,That was what an unlocked phone is supposed to be
negative,objective,"Sorry, I returned it, because it did not serve my purpose"
negative,objective,"The phone worked for about 10 month and dead - no falls, no water damage - just dead and can't be repaired"
negative,objective,"What a waste&#8230; and don&#8217;t count on Motorola to do anything for you, they couldn&#8217;t care less"
negative,subjective,"Again I only bought it because they told me that the camera was excellent but well, Phones4u has closed, haven&#8217;t they"
negative,objective,"Actually, I don&#8217;t know anybody at all who owns this phone and be aware of the weight and the size, this is a big, heavy thing"
negative,subjective,All in all it was a waste of money and I wish I had been better advised
negative,objective,Especially if you use the zoom you will get photos that are really unsharp and there is nothing you can do about that
negative,subjective,Too bad the people in the shop didn&#8217;t tell me this as I told them that I was buying it mostly for the camera
negative,objective,The photos are often out of focus but Motorola says this is normal
negative,subjective,"The camera is really bad, far worse than any my friends have"
negative,subjective,lots of money but no quality
negative,subjective,piece of junk after just over one month doesn't turn on anymore
negative,objective,"Even after couple of factory resets and then upgrading to latest firmware, the problem persists which is annoying"
negative,objective,Videos on YouTube don't work
negative,subjective,Camera quality is not satisfactory
negative,objective,The battery life has reduced drastically
negative,subjective,"If you're in the market for a budget phone, this would be a good choice but unfortunately you won't be able to browse Chrome and listen to music at the same time, or listen to music while you use Google Maps because one app or the other will end up crashing"
negative,subjective,"And while honestly it's more of an issue to rate the phone at 2 or 3 stars, I'm giving it a 1 simply because Motorola hasn't done a darn thing to contact their customers (many are dealing with this issue) and let them know that a fix is in the works"
negative,objective,Everything about this phone is great except for one big problem - it kills apps FAR too aggressively
negative,subjective,I am going to seek help because it DOES HAVE A LITHIUM battery
negative,subjective,It's also getting hot
negative,objective,"I turned it on and after the initial warm up, I get a black screen"

negative,subjective,It turns out this device is more useful as a paper weight than a phone
negative,objective,It is always losing it's signal and I am 100% sure it is not my carrier
negative,objective,This phone does not work
negative,subjective,I'd say if you're looking at this price range go for something in the Windows Phone or used iPhone range
negative,subjective,"It's really a shame, because if the phone were a little faster (and had a headphone jack that worked), it'd be a killer phone"
negative,objective,Also the headphone jack was defective after three uses

negative,objective,"Yes I am paying for a product and choose the color,"
negative,subjective,I'm just disappointed not to receive the color of the phone I bought
positive,subjective,"and all at a great price, and that makes me very happy"
positive,subjective,"However, avoiding the big mistake, is a great phone, it's fast"

negative,objective,When you call the corporate line in NJ someone literally picks up your call (without saying anything) and transfers you to the automated line which puts you in a never-ending holding cue (the same cue you get when you call their customer service and sales line
negative,objective,I spent half a day (nearly 4 hours) on hold when I dialed both the technical support line on thier website and the number for the only corporate location for the company in New Jersey
negative,objective,"What really made me return it was the fact that when you call the company BLU, there is no one to answer your call on the tech support or sales line"
negative,objective,Then it would not allow me to update the adroid software due to the the same error message
negative,objective,I could not sync my work email for the same reason
negative,objective,I could not sync my google account because it gave the &#34;cannot connect to a reliable wireless network&#34; error message even though it was connect to a wireless network AND my mobile data plan

negative,objective,"However, I purchased this phone to use as a emergency backup to connect to the internet if my home internet connection failed"
positive ,objective,"The price is right, the features are great"
negative,objective,They should be giving this device away to collect user stats and build a smart phone that is actually smart enough to wake up when you push the wake up button

negative,objective,"2 FOREVER, that means in 12 months from now this device will loose its value, will not have the new Android 5"

negative,objective,"Unbelievable, I believe we should stop putting our hard earn money into Huawei's pocket until they treat us fairly, BOYCOTT Huawei, W'E WANT UPDATED O/S for this phone"
negative,objective,"3 without any further updated, even Huawei's new budget phone come out with Android Kitkat 4"
negative,subjective,Don't waste your money on huawei
negative,subjective,Dont waste your money trust me read more comments on their fb page search huawei device usa you'll see
negative,objective,No future updates for this device huawei refused to release any updates for this device
negative,subjective,That team did not even get an update is unforgivable
negative,subjective,"I recommend not to buy it, it looks like it's official that will not receive updates to Kit Kat"
negative,subjective,This means that you can forget about this phone fully working with new gadgets coming out in the future (i
negative,objective,"Huawei just announce that they will be abandoning this phone moving forward, so forget about future updates"
negative,objective,The company promised consumers that it would update the phone to Kitkat and they are now backing out of such promise
negative,objective,Only purchased this phone because company claimed there would be at least one update to OS
negative,objective,Liewei just announced there will be no update to KitKat for the US HAM2
negative,subjective,"Do not buy this phone or trust this company, unless you don't care about ever receiving an update to Android KitKat and beyond"
negative,objective,Also they will not provide the boot loader unlock code
positive,subjective,"They had a great chance to build a loyal customer base with a decent phone but decided instead to wash their hands of the Ascend Mate 2, what makes you think the next phone will be any different"
negative,subjective,Don't be fooled into spending your hard earned money on promises in the future
negative,subjective,"Fast updates are not a deal breaker, but no updates for a phone that's only a few months old"

negative,subjective,"If Huawei just shipped stock Android, this would be a top-class phone, especially at the price"
negative,objective,"I mention them to point out that even where they might have done something interesting, they delivered a half-cooked feature"
negative,objective,"Their add-ons, like the one-hand mode or &#34;Windows on Windows&#34; (no relation to the MS technology) are laughable, stupid, useless implementations"
negative,objective,Everything they've done makes the device worse and hurts the user experience
negative,objective,Huawei literally has added nothing of value in their customization of Android
negative,objective,This is incredibly distracting and serves no other purpose other than to remind you that you're running a broken version of Android
positive,objective,The background colour on the soft buttons is a bright grey
negative,objective,"This means once a day, I accidentally hit that and close all my apps, losing open tabs or other progress"
negative,objective,Huawei broke the Android task switcher
negative,objective,"They lower the volume of other sounds, but don't actually sound off"
negative,objective,Or sometimes notifications don't play
negative,objective,"Other audio issues appear, such as text-to-speech not kicking in while playing music"
negative,objective,"It seems to be related to the power-save, as setting the timeout to a very long time reduces the problem"
negative,objective,"The OS still thinks it is playing music or other sound (it's not limited to one program), but until you stop and restart playing sound, no actual sound is produced"
negative,objective,"Using Google Play Music, once you turn off the screen by hitting the power button, the sound will stop after a short while"
negative,subjective,Huawei tweaked the audio system and actually broke basic functions like music playback
negative,objective,"Which is silly on this phone, because the battery lasts up to two days without throttling"
negative,subjective,"The processor is throttled by default to a speed so slow, even typing is laggy"
negative,objective,Huawei did nothing but impair the functionality and visual appeal of the device
negative,subjective,Which means you're stuck using their terrible version of Android
negative,objective,"Huawei doesn't release enough source or drivers to be able to flash a custom ROM, like Cyanogen"
negative,subjective,"3 version of Android, which is a very old version"
negative,objective,"However, the Huawei version of Android ruins the phone"
positive,subjective,It's quite nice not to have to always be looking for a charger
positive,subjective,"The battery is huge and regularly lasts over 30 hours, sometimes up to two days"
positive,subjective,"It feels sort of cheap, but for the price it's fine"
positive,subjective,"The screen is nice and big, yet still fits in my male clothing pockets"
positive ,objective,The Huawei Mate 2 looks great on specs for the price
negative,subjective,"Huawei software is bad, and with no Lollipop or KitKat Android updates in sight, left at a dead end"
positive,subjective,Hardware is great
negative,objective,I ended up buying a phone without any software support
negative,objective,"Try to google ""Huawei Ascend Mate 2 Android update"" and you will find the ridiculous announcement from Huawei"
negative,subjective,Be aware that you are going to buy a phone without the support of Android update
negative,subjective,"screen failed, returned, refunded"
negative,subjective,If OS upgadeability is not important to you; then it's a great phone
negative,objective,Relatively new phone and Huawei does not deliver on its kitkat promise
negative,subjective,"The worst thing is, I cannot even cancel the order now"
negative,objective,They cannot even make a sale to someone who wants it and they cannot deliver what they promise
negative,objective,"I understand that Huawei just started trying to get into the cell phone market here, but their customer services really need some improvement"
negative,subjective,"All they can do is apologize, and I even started to feel bad for them, because apparently they are not given the tools to do their job"
negative,objective,But they have no power as to how things should proceed from there
negative,objective,"For instance, they kept telling me all they can do is to email the shipping department about the issue"
negative,objective,They can only tell me that the shipping label is printed
negative,objective,"However now it's 4 business days and a weekend later (ordered last Wed), and the customer service still could not tell me whether the phone is shipped or not"
negative,objective,"This time, I cleared with the security department right after the purchase, and also paid extra for the 2-day shipping from Huawei"
negative,objective,"Apparently there is no communication between the security division and the sales/support division, and the customer is left on his own keeping track of the order"
negative,objective,"But no, no email, no communication whatsoever"
negative,objective,"The website kept crashing when I was ordering, and eventually I figured out it was because the zip code field on the order form does not accept the 4-digit after the main 5 digit zip code"
negative,objective,Which does not have Google services and does not get 4G
negative,objective,"First, the package seal was opened and phone had finger smudges all on the screen"
negative,objective,0 and a megapixel front facing camera
negative,subjective,overall the product is of very poor quality
negative,objective,the phone has problem the horn does not sound vibration mode only works when connecting headphones to listen to the radio does not work
negative,subjective,"TL;DR, if you want to use video chat, do NOT get this phone"
negative,objective,"Even her ancient iPod Touch has a front camera, as does my sub-$100 Moto G, so leaving it off of this otherwise decent device is very strange indeed"
negative,subjective,"For a tween girl, this is a no-go as it precludes the use of skype, g+ hangouts, etc"
negative,objective,we noticed it does not have a front facing camera
negative,objective,Doesnt even last a day at standby
negative,subjective,"But, the battery is a let down"
negative,objective,I am ok with other inferior fetures like its camera and how heavy it is
negative,objective,"This is false advertising the product is only 2 GB, I want refund of money"
negative,objective,"I'm unable to hear ringer or sound from apps, unless I use an ear piece which is annoyance"
negative,objective,The speaker does not works
negative,objective,"As soon as I was out of 30 day return policy, I started getting issues"

negative,objective,"This situation should have been turned around more promptly, and if that wasn't possible (which shouldn't happen; this is Motorola, not Ed's Cellphone Company), I should have been informed of the situation"
negative,objective,My issue is with the customer service
positive,objective,My wife's phone has been completely reliable and has served her well
negative,objective,"That window is closing, I've heard nothing, and I am still without a phone"
negative,objective,But it would not go out for another 4 or 5 business days
negative,objective,"She did a little more maneuvering and told me that they would send me a Moto G, an upgrade"
negative,objective,I explained to the woman that I have a cellphone because I need a cellphone and that being without the phone is a major problem for me
negative,objective,) because they didn't have any replacement phones
negative,objective,"I finally called them a few days ago, and after some time on the phone, I was informed that there was a delay (no kidding"

negative,subjective,I'm completely unsatisfied with it and Motorola hasn't given me any answers
negative,objective,51 gb of storage capacity and that's not enough for the things I planned to do with this phone

negative,objective,"Images, when viewed at full size, frequently resemble water color paintings"
negative,subjective,This is not a camera for someone who requires Dslr quality photos
positive,objective,"The battery life on the Sony is rated at 400 shots compared to Canon's 260 shots, also"
negative,objective,It seems to me that there is a bit of a lag when hitting the review button
positive,subjective,The auto white balance seems to do a good job
positive,objective,"The colors are very accurate, particularly when you have the color setting set to to R to achieve more natural looking photos"
positive,objective,Image stabilization works well on the camera
negative,objective,"Some of the settings are buried in the menu and cumbersome to get to, such as the ""format"" setting to reformat the memory card"
negative,objective,This necessitated the purchase of an external battery charger
negative,objective,"For instance, having to charge the battery in-camera puts the camera out of commission while it's recharging"
positive,objective,"After several hundred photos, I would say the HX50V meets or exceeds my expectations for image quality"
positive,objective,Lot's of functions
positive,subjective,Great operator interface
positive,subjective,Love the zoom
positive,subjective,Not too heavy
negative,objective,"if you are constantly taking blurry pics, up the ISO number which is very easy to do"
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately, I must shake too much cause most of my pictures came out blurry even I thought I was tucking in my arms to steady the shot"
negative,objective,"Also, the USB charger only provides 5 watts max so it seems that this would be a slow charge"
negative,objective,I don't like charging the battery in the camera because it creates potential trip and fall hazards when charging the camera with the cords dangling around
negative,subjective,I wish Sony included a separate wall charging unit for the battery
negative,objective,"Make sure to get a super fast class 10 memory card, or you may not find the read/write speed fast enough"
positive,objective,"Also, the WiFi works very well to quickly get a photo from the camera to your cellphone so you can send it to family and friends either by text or email"
positive,objective,What I like best about this software is we can take videos of my son and then select any frame and save it as a picture
positive,objective,With the Sony Play Memories software that is free from the Sony website you can edit photos and videos on your computer
positive,objective,"I am still learning how to use the camera, but have had amazing results with it so far even though most of the photos have only been taken in Superior Auto mode"
positive,subjective,It is a nice size
positive,subjective,"I don't know what a perfect camera is, but this packs so much into a small (it fits in my pocket) package"
positive,objective,They have instructions posted online and you will need them to enjoy all of the features
positive,subjective,Very nice camera with a lot of features
positive,objective,") For a spiffy handler with auto modes you don't have to worry about, video quality that eliminates the need for a travel camcorder along with surprisingly decent low-light chops, then we are talking"
negative,objective,"If you're looking for high-IQ innards, dirt simple user interfaces or to do a professional wedding shoot, this isn't the right brush"
negative,objective,"8 Leica lens and sport zoomability, I'd need to hire a footman from Downton Abbey to carry it for me"
positive,objective,It's a superb feat of engineering to shoe-horn that level of ability into a body this small
positive,objective,"And then, when you dip into Clear Image to try it at 60x, it still delivers sharpness"
negative,objective,"It's a low-light portrait/video performer only capable of 7x zoom, and the more you zoom, the slower it gets"
positive,subjective,Excellent all around point-and-shoot camera
positive,subjective,"The qualities of the 1080p movies were the best I have seen, even better than camcorders I have seen"
positive,objective,"For a simple point and shoot in easy mode, the camera performed above expectations, especially with the 1080p movies"
positive,subjective,A long-billed hat is essential to take quality beach pictures
negative,subjective,"Finally, the worst flaw in the camera is the LCD display which is barely visible in sunlight (much like a cell phone)"
negative,subjective,Camera had difficulty focusing on subject
negative,subjective,Cons:  Low light movies were generally poor to fair
positive,subjective,Indoor movies with moderate light were excellent
positive,subjective,Indoor pictures in low light (without flash) were very good
positive,subjective,Indoor pictures in a fairly well lit area (without flash) were excellent
positive,subjective,Battery life was very good
positive,subjective,Pictures taken at max zoom (30x + digital zoom) were also superior
positive,subjective,"Outdoor still pictures were outstanding, even with the zoom at 30X"
positive,objective,"When combined with optical and digital stabilization, the movies were nothing less than spectacular"
positive,objective,Pros:  Outstanding 1080p movies
positive,subjective,"I think this camera is built for a certain niche of people, those that like a small camera that is packed with DSLR type features"
positive,objective,I will say learn this camera and it will fit your needs for a travel sized camera with a long zoom
negative,subjective,I would also say that it is tough seeing the viewfinder in really bright sunlight unless you can find someway to shield it
positive,subjective,I like the fact I can carry a tripod that is not heavy and get use out of this camera with that
positive,subjective,I have to sometimes climb rocks and things as that
positive,objective,This camera fits the bill for ease of use with my travel pics
positive,objective,It is best to use a tripod when you wish to take really long zoom pics
negative,objective,"If you want to take long zoom pictures, the camera is pretty front heavy and the picture in the viewfinder tends to move a lot while focusing"
positive,objective,"There are a lot of features that rival DSLR cameras, including manual settings, and all in a pocket sized camera"
positive,objective,Noise levels are at 3200 and 6400 ISO or higher
positive,subjective,It takes really good pictures indoors because of the CMOS sensor
positive,subjective,I love the size and portability of this camera
positive ,objective,"Overall I do like the camera, it's zoom, it's Wi-Fi,  it's size and it's price"
negative,objective,There's is motor noise when zooming in quiet scenes
positive,subjective,"It's video recording looks good, bright, sharp, and steady"
negative,objective,"On certain modes, the processing can take several seconds after taking a picture"
negative,objective,"In order to use the flash, you have to pop-up the flash bulb, I wish that was automatic"
negative,objective,"I see a little coloration around the edges on pictures taken with maximum zoom, without digital zoom"
negative,subjective,The images from the Sony are too grainy when zooming into them
negative,subjective,"I believe the pictures are average, I like the picture quality of my old Canon SD880 IS"
negative,objective,"Although with iPad, you have to go to settings and select the camera as an access point everytime to transfer"
positive,subjective,"Love the Wi-Fi transfer and control with a Galaxy S4, Kindle fire HDX, PC, and iPad using the PlayMemories app"
positive,subjective,It's very good for a point &amp; shoot camera
positive,subjective,Pictures are sharp
positive,subjective,Great camera for somebody who knows nothing about cameras
negative,objective,"After a burst shot, you have to wait a few seconds (5-10) before you can shoot again"
negative,subjective,I'm using a UH1 class 10 32GB card with a 90MB/S write speed and it's still slow
negative,subjective,"So far, I can say that the slow write speeds are getting frustrating"
negative,subjective,"If I had paid full retail for the camera, I would have returned it and kept looking"
negative,subjective,"I'm somewhat disappointed with the camera due to the build quality issue and the overall slowness of the camera, but hoping that the other good things outweigh it in the end"
positive ,objective,"With those issues aside, the camera seems to make decent photos and has a great zoom"
negative,subjective,"Also, the camera seems very slow, no matter how fast a card I put in it"
negative,subjective,"I feel like I have to be careful pressing the buttons on the back in fear that I'll break something, oh, and the screen is very difficult, if not impossible to see in bright light"
negative,objective,"It has lots of options that make it useful; however, to me, the camera feels a bit cheaply made, more like a plastic toy camera"
positive,subjective,"Size wise, it feels good in the hand"
positive,subjective,Those two inexpensive additions have made the camera a dream to operate and use
positive,objective,"But have added a bracket holder mount and Photo Plus Sponge Handle to help me hold the camera better, especially when using the long zoom lens"
negative,subjective,"I have only had it about a month, but still find it small"
positive,subjective,Remote control via android is very cool
negative,objective,But it still takes a while to process and store the image
positive,subjective,I do realize that the image size is much larger and I do have a very fast memory card
positive,subjective,One last thing:  one of the best parts about this camera is that the pop-up flash is very reminiscent of Johnny 5 from Short Circuit
negative,subjective,I was not happy with this setting
negative,subjective,"It's hard to tell on the screen, so I didn't know until I got home that they were fuzzy"
negative,objective,"My portraits of people, on the other hand, are often out of focus"
positive,objective,"I didn't take a lot of video, but I am very happy with the capability to take stills while shooting video"
positive,subjective,I am VERY happy will all of these photos
positive,subjective,"My friend has a $3k DSLR, and my macro photos came out as nicely as his"
positive,subjective,All my photos of the landscape and buildings also came out beautifully
positive,subjective,"The pictures with the full 60x zoom came out beautifully, as did my many photos of insects and flowers"
negative,subjective,One thing I'm not crazy about is that you have to push a button to get the flash to pop up
positive,subjective,and at the moment surprisingly cheaper than the HX20V
positive,subjective,This is a really good camera in  a small package however
negative,objective,The further you reach the bigger the drop off in quality to the point the recorded image becomes a nearly unrecognizable  blur
positive,objective,It has more features and a longer digital zoom than previous models
negative,objective,"On your phone (or computer or tablet) you must download and install the Sony app ""Playmemories"" Then"
negative,objective,Need help with the Wi-Fi connection
negative,subjective,"SO--while the Sony does a good job at 75% of what I usually use a camera for (random candids), IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LANDSCAPE OR HDR IMAGING"
negative,objective,"I suspect this is mostly due to smaller sensor capturing images from miles away--the number of pixels is less relevant than the quality and size of those pixel, along with whatever post processing is occurring for jpgs in the Sony"
positive,subjective,Compared to my trusty Canon 50D in the same shot(s) there is simply no comparison
positive,objective,"Even at 100 ISO, bracketed -/+ 1 HDR post processed shots (jpg) end up grainy when magnified"
negative,subjective,Now the bad--at the top of this review I indicated that this was NOT an SLR
positive,subjective,As a carry around -- with candid people picture taking -- a very nice camera
positive,objective,The auto white balance does a great job of stabilizing color where many cameras might need tweaking to eliminate yellow cast color
positive,objective,Two general comments--this camera takes great pictures inside convention centers with a variety of lighting
negative,objective,4 stars with one knocked off for the less than intuitive Wi-Fi app
positive,subjective,"For the price, this is a great choice"
positive,objective,Another true test will come in a convention center with typical bright lights overly casting a yellow hue into most photos--will auto white balance be correct and bring things to the best color
positive,objective,Will a required 800 ISO in the absence of a flash keep noise to a minimum
positive,objective,"In current tests, with natural lighting and no flash, quality seems high"
negative,subjective,Other consideration:  Low light capability still remains a question mark
negative,objective,No NFC
negative,objective,The messages you get on the camera and in the software app are sometimes baffling and wrong
negative,objective,Things I do not like:  The Wi-Fi connection is less than intuitive and requires a web search for procedure along with some fumbling to get it to work
positive,objective,The on camera help file is really great--even allowing you to directly jump to a feature you are interested in directly from the file
positive,subjective,Menu structure and ease of use is OK for this prior Canon user
positive,subjective,Nicely textured and molded handhold allows single hand use
positive,subjective,Ergonomically:  Size and weight make this a great carry around camera
positive,subjective,"Auto focus is truly great, almost reading your mind about what you want to focus on"
positive,objective,Super zoom--30X
positive,objective,"Standard color processing in full auto is a bit more saturated than flat, most likely desirable in a camera like this--and you can dial it back"
positive,subjective,producing images most people will find very acceptable inside and out
positive,subjective,"Full auto is pretty nice, just point and shoot"
positive,objective,(An in camera double exposure HDR option is also present)
positive,subjective,"For this HDR user, the ability to shoot three bracketed photos is great"
positive,objective,"Lots of built in image options, along with full manual"
negative,objective,None of these cameras has an articulating front view screen
positive,objective,It has the image quality from a large sensor and a front facing view available
negative,subjective,I did not love the macro and focusing issues
positive,subjective,Wi-fi is nice since I have used my iphone for quick photos to add to texts--a fun option
positive,objective,If you want more professional results use a full size DLSR with quality glass
positive,objective,"With respect to reviewers saying ""DLSR quality"" for this category (it always seems to be a headline in some reviews--no matter what model), it is not true, but don't let that deter you--picture quality can be high"
positive,objective,It comes with F1
positive ,subjective,"If you are looking for high quality, you may try this"
positive,subjective,Quality of photo wise is reasonable good for a compact camera and this low price
positive,subjective,"Video quality is also good, it takes full HD and has stabilizer built in which works pretty well"
positive,objective,"If you are looking for one that can zoom in to objects, this is it"
positive,subjective,This camera has good zoom feature
positive,objective,She is a point and shoot person and it talk pictures that are good enough for that type of shooting
negative,subjective,Flash on this one is not as sturdy as the prior model
positive,subjective,Good camera excellent photos
negative,subjective,One thing I dislike is the placing of the Flash
positive ,objective,"It is pricey though, but the pictures you get using this Camera makes you forget the cost"
positive,subjective,I particularly love the panoramic feature
positive,subjective,Makes a non professional take great pictures
positive,subjective,Great all around pocket Camera fast shutter for action Photos
positive,subjective,Overall about what you'd expect out of a compact superzoom
negative,objective,"Viewed at full res, pictures show a lot of watercoloring, blur, etc"
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately, the picture quality is only so-so"
positive,subjective,"I'm also impressed with the features included in the camera -- the vast majority of Sony's advanced features can be found on this tiny little camera, making it incredibly versatile in a variety of situations"
positive ,objective,I normally shoot with larger cameras but wanted a smaller camera for more casual use while hiking or any other time that a larger camera is just more cumbersome than desired
negative,subjective,I just wish it was water resistant
positive,objective,The camera can be shot using the iPhone app and I have used it with a tripod for group photo with me in the group
positive,objective,I have taken about 4000 photos with it
positive,subjective,But basic operation is quite simple and photos are stunning
positive,subjective,"I love taking videos on it, and I love that the zoom is basically silent so causes no issues on video"
positive,subjective,Video generally VERY good quality
negative,objective,"One other note is that after about a year and a half of usage, it seems like the camera is beginning to not respond as well to commands"
negative,objective,This is probably a typical issue with non-dslr cameras anyway
positive,subjective,"However, I must say that I don't see the graininess generally at first glance, rather only when zoomed in"
positive ,objective,"I like all the features for a camera that'll fit in my pocket, though the pictures are a little too grainy for my liking"
negative,objective,It takes time between shots at night
positive,objective,"Without using the flash, my wife routinely could take 100-200 pictures a day and only needed to charge the battery every other day"
positive,subjective,Battery time is good
positive,subjective,"If you take the time to do so, you'll be amazed at what is packed into this small marvel"
positive,objective,"While you can use this camera out of the box, you'll need to read the manual if you intend to take advantage of many of the camera's advanced features"
negative,subjective,"In addition, there is a multiple shot feature with the HX50V that is a bit difficult to use"
positive,objective,The programming dial is very easy to turn inadvertently while using the camera which will change the mode of the camera without the user realizing they've done so
positive,objective,Most of the time she kept the flash off and got stunning pictures of the interiors of things that would have been impossible with a less versatile camera
positive,subjective,I was particularly impressed with its performance in low light
negative,objective,"4 megapixels is a bit of overkill, but it gives you an idea of just how good the pictures are that this camera takes"
positive,subjective,This is much more than just a simple point-and-shoot camera
negative,subjective,"On the high zoom, it's a bit tricky to find the subjectiveect and get the camera to focus correctly"
positive,subjective,"I informally compared shots between the RX100 and HX50 and didn't see a great deal of difference, except in low light situations where the RX100 was clearly better"
positive,subjective,This camera is great - amazing to fit a 30x optical zoom is such  small camera
positive,subjective,Very important to use with Sony FDA-EV1M electronic view finder
positive,subjective,"Once adjusted and set, the sound is amazing"
positive,subjective,Overall build quality is good
negative,objective,"Cons: if you are the type fidget with your headphones, then you will experience ""creeks"" from the plastic construction"
positive,subjective,"The sound is balance, but the bass is still strong and enjoyable, not overpowering like some sets"
negative,subjective,Again great sound but the fit was not quite right for me
positive ,objective,"I tried Bose, they sounded great but was looking to spend less than $150"
negative,subjective,The cups only swing out so far and this causes an unnecessarily tight fit that can be uncomfortable after some time on your head
negative,objective,I wish the earphones would be able to swing out a few more degrees to release some tension
negative,objective,"The rubber on top of the headband is somewhat thick and feels nice, but I wish it had more cushion as it sometimes feels like its digging into my head"
positive,subjective,"Compared to my previous V300's, these are somewhat heavier but I attribute that to the better construction"
positive,subjective,Comfort is important
positive,objective,"Sony has been in the audio market FOR AGES, it only makes sense that their equipment will sound AT LEAST as good as or better than whoever in Japan decided to make Beats a year ago"
positive ,objective,I have turned up the volume to 65% and heard no distortion
positive ,objective,"I don't have a Beats or any other $300 headphone to compare side by side with these, but from what I've heard when listening to the demos in store, these are easily in the same category"
positive,subjective,"With that said, I am quite happy with the sound of these headphones"
positive,subjective,The flat cord is a nice touch and I like that theres not a wire coming from each ear piece
positive,subjective,"They have a nice design look, without being too flashy like all the Beats wanna-bes"
positive,subjective,"DESIGN: Upon receiving them, I was pleased with the build quality and happy to see the whole head band was metal"
negative,objective,"They were good, but the all plastic construction was showing its weakness"
positive,objective,For the price I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone
positive,objective,Could use some sort of carrying case
positive,subjective,Looks cool and professional
negative,subjective,Even with gradual discomfort I prefer over any compared earbud
positive,subjective,A carrying case would have also been nice
positive ,subjective,The Bose AE2 were the most comfortable pair of headphones I've felt
positive,subjective,"Bass is great, not as great as 50mm drivers but certainly worth the price"
positive,objective,It will make music on ipods and cell phones sound better where other headphones can show you more mistakes if your using low quality mp3 files
negative,subjective,They can be a little bass heavy but you can EQ that to your liking
positive ,objective,Traded them for a set of these Sony headphones and was amazed at the quality of both the highs and low bass reproduction
negative,subjective,"The bass on them just felt very flat, cheap even"
positive,subjective,Great sound
negative,subjective,can bother if you use the headphones for a long long time
positive,subjective,I have the beats solo hd and sony sound much better
negative,subjective,It would have been better if it had some noise cancelling technology in it
positive,subjective,Great value for the price
negative,objective,"The band is not quite as comfortable as the V500's (and nowhere near as comfy as the V700's), but I got used to it"
positive,subjective,"Other than that, great stereo sound and overall comfortable feel"
negative,subjective,My only real complaint is that the cord is too short
positive,subjective,Great quality and great sound
positive,subjective,They sound great and look cool
positive,subjective,"Great set for sitting down, or on the computer"
negative,subjective,These aren't very good jogging headphones because you can hear the plastic creaking while moving
positive,objective,"As other people have been saying, the build quality is average"
positive,subjective,Good headphones for the price
negative,subjective,it makes hard to listen music with them more than an hour
negative,objective,a few songs later it hurts my ears because of the pressure
positive,subjective,i highly recommend it for the sound quality ecpecially for that price range
positive,subjective,i am not a professional listener but it has great sound
negative,subjective,"Just one little problem, they're a little heavy"
positive,subjective,Headphones are really good and great sound
positive,objective,Update- I did end up stretching the headphones a little bit and they are much more comfortable now
negative,subjective,But if you can handle the slight ear discomfort this headphones are superb
positive,objective,I watched a movie with it on and I had adjust occasionally adjust them around my right ear during the movie due to ear soreness
positive,subjective,Sound quality is incredible especially with my Hp beats audio laptop
positive,subjective,"Overall, Great product, nice alternative to the Beats for great price"
positive,subjective,I feel that for the price it is a better value than the Bose that I was considering
positive ,objective,"Overall happy with the sound quality, look, feel, and comfort"
positive,subjective,Would recommend to anyone looking for home/office use
positive,subjective,"I wish they did that better but overall, the sound quality is great and exactly what your looking for in a headphone"
negative,subjective,The only downside to these headphones is the lack of noise cancelation
positive,objective,"I got these headphones for about $50 and for the price, they're really good"
positive,subjective,I agree that they are comparable with Beats Audio
negative,objective,"My only complaint is that these are not ""DJ"" headphones"
positive,subjective,"I prefer good audio quality with concessions in the ergonomics department if it means a decent sound, and the V55's fit the bill with limited money"
positive ,objective,"Reflex volume increases maintain the balance well, without being piercing to the ear drums"
positive,subjective,"Having said that, the V55's accomplish low, mids, and highs pleasantly well"
positive,objective,"The V55's accomplish *enough* separation to be enjoyable, and since these V55's will soon be tattered with out-on-the-go duty, the sound stage is decent enough for regular heavy use"
positive,subjective,"This is a great headset, the clarity and the bass is great, I would deffinately recommend it"
positive,subjective,The sound is great and very clear especially after some use
positive,subjective,I got them at a pretty good price point
negative,objective,) I also definitely wish they came with a protective case or pouch of some sort
negative,subjective,"These are not the best in this area, they definitely leak a bit and they're not the best and canceling out noise"
positive ,subjective,That being said these headphones are great and I love the aesthetics of them
positive,subjective,They sound a lot better than the beats solo which cost $199
positive,subjective,These are great sounding headphone that will not break the bank
positive ,subjective,They have good sound that isn't washed out with Bass and the no tangle cord it heavenly
positive,subjective,The sound is awesome on these
negative,subjective,It can sound a little muffled since treble is not quite accentuated
negative,subjective,The only gripe I have is the creaking sound they make when you move them
positive,subjective,These headphones are a great value and sound awesome
positive,objective,"I bought these for my teenage son, he gave the 4 star rating and had this to say about the headphones: &#34;Sturdy head phones with excellent sound quality&#34;"
negative,objective,"I can hear all the sounds in the orchestra, such as white noise (shifting of performers or the small breath of someone playing the clarinet)"
positive,subjective,"Classical comes to life as well, as it sounds warm to me"
positive,subjective,"For dance, the bass comes out and everything it pretty clear sounding"
negative,subjective,"With rock, however, the sounds kind of becomes more muddy to me and it doesn't do the songs much justice"
positive,subjective,"But while listening to music, the cups do a decent job of passive noise canceling"
negative,subjective,So definitely not good for long flights or all-day wear
negative,subjective,"The pads aren't that soft despite the pictures, and the band tends to squeeze the cups to your ear"
negative,objective,"Like some others said, these headphones aren't very comfortable, as they sit on your ear instead of around it"
negative,subjective,Another complaint is the comfort
positive,subjective,"I liked how it didn't tangle, and how it only connected to one ear cup"
negative,objective,"It would've been very convenient, because after a year and a half of use, my chord has gone dead, so while the components in ear cups still work fine, I can't listen to them anymore because something in the chord is loose from wear and tear"
negative,objective,I also don't like how the chord isn't detachable like the Sony MDR10Rs and other models
positive ,subjective,The style of these headphones are awesome too
positive,objective,"Granted, those were $30"
positive ,objective,"The build is very stable and solid, even though it's made of plastic"
positive,subjective,They have a clear sound to them with just enough bass for me to be satisfied whenever I listen to electronic or dance music
positive ,subjective,I'm no audiophile and these are the only good headphones I've owned so far
positive,subjective,The quality and sound are great
positive,subjective,Looks great too
positive,subjective,Great sound for price
positive,objective,Shipped on time
negative,subjective,A little too small
positive,subjective,The sound is great
positive,subjective,These headphones are great for the price
negative,subjective,I thought theses were good headphones but they are very uncomfortable $55 worth the price for sound quality
negative,objective,"That was one of our deciding factors for purchasing these headphones, so we were disappointed when we received these without the volume control dial"
positive,subjective,These headphones have great audio sound for the price
positive ,subjective,"They feel nice and look cool, although I wish they also came in all black"
positive ,objective,"For just $60, they're comfortable, portable, adjustable, practical and POWERFUL (at full volume, people around you and in other rooms will get second hand vibes): they pump out both good, WELL-BODIED BASS and clear, LOUD TREBLE, while the cable is flat, tangle-free and of the right length for portable players or computers"
negative,objective,The cited is to short if you are going to use them to actually DJ with
positive ,subjective,Too summarize this I definitely recommend these especially for the sound you get at this price; but if you have an extra $60 too dish out I would recommend the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones
positive,subjective,The bass is nice and clean and these headphones produce a rich sound
positive,subjective,These headphones definitely rival that of the beats brand in terms of sound
negative,subjective,"If you wear glasses you might want to give yourself some time to adjust to the pressure being put on your ears because it can cause some pain, but it goes away after a few days of use"
negative,objective,My only problem with these is that my ears tend to get hot after more than 30 minutes and the pads start to hurt my ears after more than an hour
positive,objective,"At the same time, pop/ hip hop/ r&b; sound great with these too"
positive,subjective,I think these work the best with music that isn't heavily produced because you can hear so much and the quality of the music isn't muddied by the base or changed too drastically
positive,subjective,The highs are pretty good and the base is ample for anyone who wants a mostly even listening experience
positive ,subjective,For this price these are some really awesome headphones
positive,subjective,They look good and are very portable
positive,subjective,"For the price,  I would say these sound as good as the beats solo"
positive ,subjective,They are a great product and cheap alternative to Beats
positive,subjective,They are lighter
positive,objective,Beats -  you don&#34;t need batteries
positive,objective,Ive used these in an office and I cant hear a thing around me
positive,subjective,They really block out sound
positive,subjective,Even in noisy areas these sound ok
positive,subjective,"First things first, they sound great for normal use in quite areas"
negative,subjective,"Other reviewers have noted that they're not great to wear when you work out, but seriously- get earbuds for that"
positive,objective,"I've tested the $100+ headphones like Beats by Dre and Bose, and honestly the sound they produce is barely better- if at all- than what you get with this Sony set"
positive,objective,"Most Sony headphones that I tried, even $150 - $300 pairs, didn't have near the clarity this pair had"
negative,objective,Like the sound but ear lobes get uncomfortable very quick
negative,subjective,"These are super comfortable, the only reason I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is I think they're a little unnecessarily clunky, and the material on the earpieces is a tiny bit thin"
positive,objective,The cord is a flat rubber cord so that it doesn't get tangled
positive,subjective,Never thought the sound gonna be so good like this
negative,objective,"They are not noise cancelling, and even over the ear I had to turn down the TV while I was listening, so you probably cannot tune out the wife or husband or rug rats (I am sure they are lovely children) without excessive volume"
positive,subjective,Acoustic bass sounds natural and real
positive ,objective,"So, in a nutshell, great dynamic range, great resolution at high frequencies, good stereo imaging, but not perfect, very good efficiency at 105db, which means they get pretty loud with any device, and bass response is actually very good"
positive,objective,"Then knowing I will also listen to older recordings, not mixed for headphones, I loaded up &#34;Skating away on the thin ice of a new day&#34; by Jethro Tull (2002 remastered version) and felt it sounded fantastic"
positive ,objective,"On the classical side, Sarah Chang's recording of Ralph Vaughn William's &#34;The Lark Ascending&#34; was almost a religious experience for me, the headphones reproduced all of the high frequency violin solo parts with extreme clarity with virtually no harshness and I was able to hear the tension of the bow on the strings and even some parts where the triangle plays alongside a high note trill that I never noticed before until I listened to it with these headphones"
positive ,objective,"Plus, they look great; even being white they haven't gotten dirty yet, and I take these everywhere"
positive ,objective,The sound is wonderful for a real decent price
negative,objective,"Also, it is really easy for other people to hear your music if you have it at high-ish volumes"
negative,objective,After a long time of listening to music I'll take these off and my ears will be really sore
positive,subjective,great sound quality and comfort packaging was nice
positive,subjective,Very good sound quality
positive,subjective,"Great sound, they just don't keep the sound in the headphones as others around you will hear what your listening too"
negative,objective,"Like a lot of DJ headphones, the sound skews towards the low end and details are muddled in the higher frequencies"
positive,objective,"With a short cord and foldable ear cups, they make great portable cans that can be thrown in a backpack"
positive,subjective,The MDR-V55s are well designed and durable
positive,subjective,I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera for a good price
positive,objective,It can take pictures even in the darkest place
positive,subjective,It functions very well
negative,objective,It goes out in a couple or few years and then you send it in to get it &#34;repaired&#34; not knowing what happened
positive,subjective,The various levels of megapixel quality is great
negative,subjective,Hope the zoom is good
positive,subjective,Shipping could have been much more faster
positive,subjective,Awesome product with all features
positive ,objective,"It's light, aesthetic and I would definitely recommend it - it's not difficult to carry around and obviously surpasses the photo quality of an iPhone or any other smartphone"
positive,subjective,"Otherwise, this camera is great for its price"
positive,subjective,The shutter speed is not too quick but it gets the job done
positive,subjective,"The pictures taken with flash are better than the regular pictures, which may come out a bit grainy"
positive,subjective,It's a good camera with a great battery life
negative,subjective,"good camera, however it comes without a memory card, you have to purchase that separately"
negative,objective,"To hear the sound, you plug it into a computer and play the movie"
negative,objective,"In fact, you won't hear anything at all, regardless of what level you set the volume (the highest level is 4 in Settings)"
negative,objective,"Also, there is no volume adjustment while playing back a movie on the camera"
negative,objective,This shouldn't be a problem if you don't send pictures to people in other countries where the date format is Day/Month/Year
negative,objective,", AUG for August) but not on the actual picture's date stamp"
negative,objective,"And even when you set the date to 'English' month, it displays the English month only on the screen (i"
negative,objective,A coupla things different from my old camera: the battery remaining time does not show the number of minutes left in each mode
positive,subjective,Setting everything on auto including flash is the best option
positive,subjective,This one is much smarter looking and has a much larger screen and bigger memory capacity for such a small camera
positive,subjective,Easily fits in your shirt pocket
positive,subjective,Small and compact easy to use
positive,subjective,nice camera like the panoramic picture ability
positive,subjective,a very good high resolution camera
positive,subjective,meets my need for a point and shoot camera
positive,subjective,"does not do as well in low light as some others I have owned, but for the price I am well satisfied"
positive,objective,"I have taken only a few pictures, and they are sharp and could easily be enlarged"
positive,subjective,Awesome point &amp; shoot for a beginner camera
positive,subjective,I was pleasantly surprised with the photo &amp; video quality
positive,subjective,Nice small camera for my daughter who loves it
positive,subjective,Take good pictures
positive,subjective,"Replaced loss camera, this one is good for the price"
negative,objective,camera works great am having  problems with download of manual
positive,subjective,"It's a camera that has cool specifications and for the price you pay, you are going to receive a bunch of characteristics that make the purchase a good deal"
positive,subjective,"For the price is a good producy, very convenient for traveling and home"
positive,subjective,Other than that it works well as a simple camera where I can select a portion of the image to display
negative,objective,To display them I have to go to a windows 7 system and reduce the pixel count and then move them to my system
negative,subjective,It seems the files are somewhat too large to display in my system
positive,subjective,Works easy and well
positive,subjective,Camera looks as it looks in photo
negative,subjective,At times it processes a little slower than I would like in low light
positive,subjective,It works well
positive ,subjective,Does what you need a camera in that price range to do and more
positive,subjective,A Great Camera for the price
positive,subjective,It's really good for the price
positive,subjective,have been satisfied with the pictures I've taken
positive,subjective,like the rechargeable battery
positive,subjective,like the size of the camera - fits in my pocket or purse easily
positive,subjective,I like it very much it is simple and easy to use
positive,subjective,"He's taken close ups, portrait and landscape in bright and low light and it seems to auto adjust pretty well"
positive,subjective,Battery life seems to be pretty good after a couple days' use
negative,subjective,"I would just warn that it does have a little lag in taking photos, however, if you can live with that minor inconvenience then you should love this"
positive,subjective,It is a wonderful camera that takes excellent pictures
positive,subjective,It has great quality and it is so easy to use
positive,subjective,"very compact, seems to take decent pictures"
positive,subjective,takes great pictures and a lot of effect options such as b/w etc
positive,subjective,"great little camera, small enough to fit in gf purse easy to use, wish it was touch screen"
positive,subjective,"If you want a portable camera that won't let you down, this is the only game in town right now"
positive ,objective,Sony's improvements have been pretty awesome and I can't wait to see what they do when they have mastered their lens element fusing technique used in the rx100 iii
positive,subjective,"So all said, this camera is awesome (don't sweat the small stuff)"
positive,subjective,"Despite my feelings about the AWB and power button, this is the absolute best pocketable camera on the market by a landslide"
positive,subjective,No doubt this camera can do great things and has very versatile raw files but I have no desire to edit these files and it is meant to be a quick fix when I want a picture
negative,objective,"Also, that simple menu is only available under the auto modes and does not activate under the A,S or M modes"
negative,objective,The downside is that it resets everytime you turn the camer off
positive,objective,If you click down on the rear dial it brings up a simple settings menu
positive,objective,UPDATE: So if you don't mind shooting in the Auto modes then there is a pretty good solution
positive,subjective,If you prefer cool tones in your images this is a no brainer
positive,subjective,Definitely the best pocket camera out there
negative,objective,I have to be very careful when holding the camera as you barely have to press the button to activate the power
negative,subjective,When this happens you are greeted with the unpleasant sound of the motor griding to push the lens out through your pocket
negative,subjective,This is a scary thing to do as the lens shoots out as soon as the power goes on
negative,objective,The only other con to this camera is the On/Off button
negative,objective,I know I can set multiple manual white balances with this camera but my purpose in getting this was to have a small camera for everyday use that I can shoot JPEG's with in aperture priority and have no editing to do in post
negative,objective,Maybe the average consumer won't notice but I look at images all the time when I edit for weddings and these colors are off
negative,objective,This comes across as a slightly blue and green tint in photos
positive,subjective,This is impressive for a camera with a sensor this small
positive,subjective,The low light results have been reasonably good up to about 1600 iso and I allow it to go up to 3200 iso sometimes if I really need a shot
positive,subjective,"The image quality, in terms of focus and clarity, is excellent"
positive,subjective,The viewfinder is very neat but to be honest I haven't found a situation where I've wanted to use it yet (that doesn't mean that I won't but I haven't as of yet)
positive,objective,We've taken more pics together since getting this camera than in the past year simply because it is easy to do
positive,objective,The fact I can flip it around 180 degress to take a picture with my wife and then rotate it to 45 degrees down to shoot over my head is so useful I can't recommend it enough
positive,subjective,"My favorite feature, that incredible rotating LCD"
positive,subjective,It seems very solid (except the popout flash which feels like I'm going to break it every time I push it back in) for being so small but at the same time there is so much packed into a tiny space I'm constantly worried I'm going to break something
positive,subjective,It is a tiny camera even if the previous generations are small as well
positive,subjective,When it arrived the first thing I noticed was how compact it really is
positive,objective,"Size, large aperture, 24-70mm equivalent, image stabalized AND has a revolutionary built in EVF"
negative,objective,"Not becuase I didn't like it, because I did, but because it was simply too big to fit in my pocket and its weird in camera rendering to skin tones when the iso increased"
negative,objective,"- I wish the NFC/Wifi connect was faster, it&#8217;s not slow but one would hope could be made faster"
negative,objective,But since you can't select which picture effects are enabled you have to scroll through all the options every time
negative,objective,This is especially missed when zooming in/out during playback
negative,objective,"I mean at this point almost everything is touch screen, this just seems like a strange oversight in such an amazing camera"
negative,objective,"- Closing the view finder shuts down the camera, which doesn't make sense"
negative,objective,"There are a few minor CONS, some which already existed in the previous models and some which hopefully can be fixed via a BIOS update (one can always hope"
positive,subjective,8 max aperture is outstanding (a very nice upgrade from the last two RX100 models)
positive,subjective,This is simply the best pocket camera there is right now
positive,subjective,I don't regret buying this camera because this is the best pocket camera right now
negative,objective,This is why I took half a star because I couldn't really just point and shoot
negative,subjective,I prefer to use the PASM modes because the superior and intelligent auto modes wasn't working for me
negative,objective,Don't expect to zoom in on a far away subjectiveect
positive,subjective,The portraits and city landscape pictures I took came out great
positive,objective,"Bottom line, great and expensive camera, you gotta treat it gently"
negative,objective,The back screen does not click back into place when you're done tilting it
positive,subjective,"The viewfinder is a great touch but here again, even though it is well built, it appears quite delicate and unlikely to tolerate rough handling"
positive,subjective,Amazing how every single camera manufacturer competes to build the thinnest door possible
negative,objective,the battery door is somewhat flimsy and will not tolerate too much rough handling
positive ,objective,"I have owned this camera for a week or so, and find that the pictures I have taken come out in sharp focus, with excellent metering"
positive ,subjective,"So if you have a use case that is similar to mine, I'd recommend the camera"
negative,subjective,I don't fault Sony that Apple doesn't support NFC but the interface on Sony's iOS app is pretty weak
positive,objective,"Finally, the built in WiFi transfer is serviceable for iOS devices"
positive,subjective,"""  This is a very nice feature"
positive,objective,"But if that is not enough, it will engage the ND filter to enable you to ""open up the lens"
positive,objective,"Second, there is a built in ND (neutral density) filter that is automatically ""turned on"" if, like me, you are seeking to shoot with the lens ""wide open"" in sun light"
negative,subjective,"but I should point out that the sound of zoom ""motor"" is audible in the recording"
positive,objective,A couple of other features I enjoy: you can shoot video in black and white
positive,subjective,The zoom range is nice: 24-70mm
positive,subjective,But it is VERY good for the size and price
positive,subjective,Is the sensor really as good as Leica's
positive,objective,There are two other monochrome settings to use as well but I am having lots of fun with the high contrast setting
positive,objective,"And for the black and white film purists out there, fasten your seat belt: the high contrast monochrome setting on the Sony will knock your socks off"
positive,subjective,"but I'm not a pixel peeper so if the jpeg output of my digital camera is decent, I'm happy"
positive,subjective,"So while the low light capture capability is nice, the shallow depth of field"
positive,objective,"it fits perfectly in the palm of my hand, has a moderate zoom, does very well in low light, and has an acceptable though not outstanding shallow depth of field capability"
negative,objective,"And fitting a zoom on it, makes it even larger"
negative,objective,"""  But the iPhone lacks the ability to provide any real shallow depth of field, which I enjoy for portraits and to give images that ""3D"" appearance"
positive,subjective,"Summary of my thoughts: a good ""palm sized"" camera that outperforms a smartphone but is still some distance from an interchangeable lens camera"
negative,subjective,The only thing I wish it had is a  larger zoom capability
positive,subjective,The viewfinder is very sharp
positive,subjective,Slips easily into my pocket
positive,subjective,Love the size (that's why I bought it)
positive,subjective,Operational controls are mostly intuitive
positive,subjective,Image quality is very good
positive,subjective,It's a great backup/B Camera that I would consider a professional instrument
negative,subjective,Don't let this cameras small size fool you
negative,objective,iii)No GPS functions
negative,subjective,ii) It would be nice if it was touchscreen
negative,objective,"While this isn't a huge disadvantage for everyday shooting, it is when you consider you can't remove the lens on this camera"
negative,objective,"2) Lens aperture has been improved, but you lose some telephoto range"
negative,objective,Sony should integrate the flash into the body (Like the panasonic LF1) and return the Hot Shoe
negative,subjective,I was unable to attach a microphone or light units easily because of this
negative,subjective,This is a big disadvantage when using the camera for video
negative,objective,1) Hot Shoe detachment has been removed
positive,objective,-Screen can go 180 for self-portraits or to monitor when using video
positive,objective,Slides back into Camera when not in use
positive,subjective,"Small enough to put in your pocket, yet much better results than cameras in this size class"
positive,subjective,This is a great 1&#34; sensor camera
negative,subjective,Plus I am a little peeved that someone in the camera forum says that if you call sony and ask about the camera and express doubt they will offer you a 125$ accessory bonus if you buy the camera then
negative,objective,(By the way if you are thinking I should have bought a case I did but ADORAMA cameras did not send it to me and still hasn't 10 days later
negative,objective,However after one day of being in my purse (without keys) it is all scratched up
negative,subjective,This is a great camera so far but the pop up flash seems so fragile
negative,objective,Dual microphones on the top of the camera are easy to cover by mistake when filming
negative,objective,"Occasional delays on startup, where I am locked out of camera"
positive ,objective,Unintuitive menu system
negative,objective,No 4K video (Even though the hardware is capable)
positive,subjective,Articulated screen is really handy for awkward shots
positive,subjective,"Beautifully smooth, compression artifact free video"
positive,subjective,Highly portable (though not comfortably pocketable in my opinion)
positive,subjective,Great image quality
negative,subjective,"On the other hand, my DSLR is a terrible video camera in almost all real-life filming conditions"
positive,subjective,"I love shooting stills with my DSLR, I love the large viewfinder and I love my 85mm portrait lens"
negative,objective,"In these modes the display is littered with information, very little of which makes much sense"
negative,subjective,I have googled the intelligent auto and intelligent auto plus modes half a dozen times and still don't know what they do
negative,objective,"I keep finding I want to touch the screen on this camera, and the fact I can't bothers me"
negative,subjective,"If your subject is sharply focused and the light is good, the video is to die for"
positive,subjective,"All my criticisms aside, I am keeping the camera because the video quality is so much better than my iPhone and shooting is so much easier than it is with my DSLR"
positive,subjective,Before leaving the topic of video I would like to stress that this camera shoots amazing video
negative,subjective,"Incidentally, exporting the video to my Mac is not the easiest process"
positive,subjective,The headroom 4K gives you for cropping/correcting on a 1080p timeline is also wonderful
positive ,objective,I have used their 4K camcorder and the video is spectacular
negative,objective,I saw the high-frame-rate version of The Hobbit and was slightly sickened by it
positive,objective,"With this codec I can shoot extremely complicated visual scenes, a forest in bright daylight for example, pan the camera and see no compression artifacts at all"
positive,subjective,I have always wanted  a discretely sized excellent quality video camera and the specs in this seemed to fit the bill
negative,objective,"Since the viewfinder is one of the main reasons to by the Mark III instead of the Mark II, let the buyer beware"
negative,subjective,"If you are over 50 and have trouble focusing on nearby objects, you may find the viewfinder unusable"
negative,objective,I find myself having to remove my glasses and use the viewfinder with my naked eye
negative,objective,"The second problem is more serious, but applies only if you wear eyeglasses: the pop-up viewfinder is just not usable with eyeglasses"
negative,objective,"First, the camera contains a computer so powerful that the user-interface experience is a nightmare"
negative,objective,Instead one has to manually force the flash to pop up using a very hard to find button
positive ,objective,"Second, having a wider angle really does help getting more into the picture especially when you are close to the subjectiveect"
positive,subjective,The tiltable screen is a very nice touch
negative,objective,On the mkI the skin tones were gorgeous on the soft skin mode on low
negative,objective,- The soft skin mode on the mkIII doesn't work
negative,subjective,"The camera has a lot of nice new features, but in the end, I prefered the images of my original RX100, specially for day time and portrait pictures"
positive,subjective,"If you want a pocketable camera for photos that you can take occasional videos, the RX 100iii does a good job"
negative,subjective,"If you want a good video DSLR, look at the Panasonic GH4"
negative,objective,The microphone is not great
negative,objective,"It chooses really bizarre frame rates, really inappropriate for video filming"
negative,subjective,I hate the video mode on the dial
negative,objective,"In video mode, the camera will crop heavily unless you turn Active Steady Shot off"
positive,subjective,"On the video end, the XAVC-S is a great codec (but maybe overkill for the quality the camera can deliver)"
negative,objective,"While it'll never get the look of a full-frame or APS-C size sensor, the F1"
negative,objective,One of the problems with a smaller camera is that you can't get shallow depth of field
positive,subjective,I think it does a pretty good job for photos
negative,objective,The only problem I've had so far is with the panorama mode
positive,objective,That will give me a higher end underwater camera than the AW120 and access to greater zoom and perhaps some of my Nikkor lenses via the adapter
negative,objective,8 lens has few peers in the market as far as I can tell
positive,objective,"The display can be easily positioned for selfies, overhead and ground level shots"
positive,objective,It slips in the pocket of my cargo pants very easily
negative,objective,I also wanted great low light capability for times when a flash isn't allowed or is inconvenient
positive,subjective,good quality picture
positive,subjective,Nice &amp; easy compact camera with a great bokeh
negative,subjective,"It wasn't a good fit in a jacket pocket, for the same reason"
negative,objective,It is too large and too heavy for that purpose
negative,subjective,"I liked it a lot, but it is NOT a pocket camera"
negative,subjective,What makes it so expensive
positive,subjective,This camera has the quality of a 600$ camera
positive,subjective,Best compact camera available today
positive,objective,In some instances its photos look almost as good as my old Nikon D300
positive,subjective,Great image quality (both photos and video) for a compact point-and-shoot camera
positive,subjective,Auto focus indoors in low light could be better
negative,subjective,I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't shut down when I close the viewfinder
negative,subjective,But its a bigger camera so that's the tradeoff
positive,subjective,Downsized from an OMD EM-5 which had superior results
positive,subjective,Great pocketable camera - superior to others I've tried
negative,subjective,I just wish there was more quality control for such an expensive camera
negative,objective,"The third camera didn't have the issue with the lens, but like the second the EVF wasn't as springy and needed a little help to get all the way up to where you could slide out the eye piece"
negative,objective,I returned this camera too because of the lens issue again
negative,objective,"Its EVF didn't lock into place when you popped it up, instead you had to pull it the rest of the way up before you could slide it forward"
negative,objective,The second one also had this same defect on the same spot of the lens (bottom left as you face the front of the camera)
negative,objective,"However, it had some manufacturing defect on the lens that looked like the glass was scratched on some interior lens element"
positive,objective,The first one had a solid EVF that would pop up smoothly and lock into place
positive ,objective,"I'm only going to talk about the quality issues in my review, but the camera does take amazing pictures and is convenient because of its small size"
negative,objective,"One suggestion, buy extra batteries for back up"
negative,subjective,I would like to see +- 2 stops in 1 stop increments
negative,subjective,I wish the auto bracketing function enabled a wider range of f/stop bracketing for HDR post processing
positive,subjective,Great size for backpacking
positive,subjective,Incredible quality for the size
positive,subjective,this is a great camera and it is so hard to balance the tradeoff of size versus image quality
positive,subjective,I never used the pop-up viewfinder which may have accounted for the good battery life
positive,objective,"Note: I am coming from a Nikon D700 DSLR with 4 lenses (I got tired of lugging it all around), and this compact camera was/is very, very convenient for travel while still offering high quality images"
negative,objective,"Software helped correct some of this, but not totally"
negative,objective,"I found the biggest drawback was washed out colors in mixed lighting (bright background, shaded foreground) and should have made more use of bracketing"
positive,objective,"On a trip to Utah, I took over 1000 photos in RAW mode on a 64GB memory card and clarity and colors snap out"
positive ,objective,"Pros: nice and small; generally, very good results in ""perfect mode"" (see ""cons""); ""selfies"" easy to take with rotating lcd display, bracketing modes make for very pleasing results in mixed lighting; better than expected battery life; clear, strong colors; great for travel;  great detail at 20MPs; many many options/features"
positive,subjective,Good compact with fantastic results
positive,objective,I'm used to instruction manuals that go over every feature in detail
positive,objective,"The Help Guide, which you can find online and is downloadable is definitely required"
positive ,subjective,This camera has serious capabilities and the manual simply skims over the detail on how use most of the features
negative,subjective,The other complaint is the instruction manual
positive,objective,Yes Sony offers a Raw Converter program that has some simply editing capability but serious editing requires Lightroom and/or Photoshop
negative,objective,Sony could have used the DNG format which would allow me to import directly into LIghtroom
negative,objective,I use Abobe Lightroom and Photoshop so I have to use the Adobe Raw Plug In to convert the files in the DNG format before I can bring them into LIghtroom
positive,subjective,"The picture quality is very good and it does offer the major of features (RAW file format, manual exposure/shutter adjustment, etc)"
positive,subjective,While it can't replace my DSLR's it's very lightweight and it will easy fit into a pocket
negative,subjective,The only drawback is not supplying neck strap
negative,objective,"Alternatively, for iPad, buy AppleSD &gt; Lighting Connector ($29), set up and view/transfer photos as desired to an iPad - does not work on an iPhone (there is a camera to lightening connector too)"
negative,objective,Here's what to do AFTER inputting WiFi and Password into camera per the included instructions
negative,objective,"The next night, I went back to the store (sometimes a physical store is what you need) Ythe camera Connect's easily - the issue is the instructions"
positive,subjective,All-around a very good camera for versatile shooting
positive,objective,$450) or the SEL50f1
positive,objective,"While the RX100 is pocketable, the NEX-5t has a larger sensor, interchangeable lens capabilities, and is cheaper or the same price even when paired with an EXCEPTIONAL lens like the SEL35f1"
positive,subjective,"Now that the cost has gone down, this is a great buy if you want portability plus power in your shooter"
positive ,subjective,"It's compact enough, while still giving me the really good pictures that I've seen from the bigger cameras"
positive,objective,Take a look at some of the shots I've included and if you get make sure you get the case and do the the mod
positive,subjective,It's not as compact as others but it's not as large as a full blown cannon
positive,subjective,"VIDEO:  Good video, probably comparable to iPhone 6"
positive,subjective,OUTSIDE LIGHT:  Shoots really nice shots
positive,objective,You may be able to upload to computer wifi as well
positive,objective,WIFI:  You can drop photos right onto your phone for upload to Facebook
positive,subjective,I felt like I shot better shots in the manual mode adjusting the ISO myself
positive,objective,Then it pieces them all together to make one great shot
positive,subjective,"One thing thats cool is when it shoots multiple shots at once, like 9"
positive,subjective,It handled the colors pretty good
negative,objective,"Like anything, you gotta shoot a bunch to get a few"
positive,subjective,LOW LIGHT:  I thought the camera did a fairly good job in low light
positive,objective,It will open up like a clam and be a an unbelievable case that fits snugly and secure
negative,subjective,I can't believe they didn't let it rotate straight up or even back to bounce light
negative,subjective,FLASH:  I hate the flash
positive,subjective,"The camera feels well built, not cheap"
positive,subjective,This one was small enough that it doesn't look like a full production
negative,subjective,It is useful for snapshots but I think my iPhone might be better
negative,subjective,"(which I hate, due to its very small color-depth) Me as a long time Canon to photoshop guy am used to loading the raw straight into photoshop for grading, etc"
negative,objective,The color and contrast is a bit wacky and the raw files will not load into photoshop without being converted to some other format such as Tiff
positive,subjective,Well I love the daylight shots but the indoor shots are not happening
positive,subjective,"The different shooting modes are handy; macro works well, and I really like the auto function"
negative,objective,The toggle at the shutter button is the on/off switch which had me turning the camera off more than once as I got used to the controls
positive,subjective,"This compact little camera takes great pictures in JPEG and RAW, you will not regret the purchase"
positive,subjective,I would highly recommend buying a lens cover that you can attach to your camera as it is very small and easily lost
negative,objective,Lens 16-50 has big vignetting and barrel distortion at 16 mm in RAW  (auto corrected in JPEG)
positive,subjective,The moveable touch screen display is a good option for selfies but would work if the flash is installed
positive,subjective,Great quality pictures ( see attached pic) without requiring to carry an SLR camera
positive,subjective,"For the deal price offered in Dec '14, this is a great camera"
negative,objective,Not that great at Noise reduction past ISO 3200
positive,subjective,Very interesting the Apps that can be used with the gear
positive,subjective,299 is a good price for this camera as it is already a bit out of time now
positive,objective,The flash can be set to Auto/On/Off and it does have a panaromic mode
negative,subjective,One thing I noticed is that there are not too many photo modes as I would like
negative,objective,Haven't really played with the 8x zoom yet
positive,subjective,The picture quality is good
positive,subjective,Got this one and was surprised at how compact it was
positive,subjective,But its perfect for taking pics on vacations
positive,subjective,I think Sony is one of the better pocket digital cameras available
positive,subjective,Works fine and size is perfect
positive,subjective,It took great pictures in the field which i was able to download to my computer when we got home
positive,subjective,Pictures are very good in Auto everything mode
positive,objective,There are options if you want to use them but the &#34;Easy&#34; mode is great for just point and shoot
positive ,subjective,It great performs great used it at a wedding yesterday pictures came out perfect so did video
positive ,subjective,"Everything works great on this camera, price is great,  but there is no macro focus"
positive,subjective,"Overall, the Sony is a great camera that takes sharp pictures indoors or out"
positive,objective,The advantage of the Canon over the Sony is the lens retracts completely into the camera body flat whereas the Sony lens protrudes a little bit even when the lens is retracted and closed
positive,objective,"Simpler, easier to use menu system and a standard usb cable for charging directly to the camera without removing the battery"
positive,objective,I returned it and the second one has no problems focusing indoors quickly
negative,objective,the only down side was that it takes a long time after I press the button to take the picture before it snaps the picture
positive,subjective,Great little camera for the price
negative,objective,Only thing is you need to purchase a memory no space on the camera without it
positive ,subjective,Great price and what a great small camera
positive,subjective,Nice optical zoom
positive,objective,"I presumed that it just needed the firmware update, so I tried to apply it; but my camera doesn't need it, it has a serial number with the 6th digit of '3', meaning it ALREADY has the new firmware on it"
negative,objective,"Back to Amazon (who blew my socks off by having a replacement to my house on Christmas eve, 1"
negative,objective,"Then the unit failed after 3 weeks; screen flickered with a bunch of fuzzy lines, turned off and would never turn on again"
negative,objective,I couldn't get more than 20 seconds of video
negative,objective,"And to be clear, it doesn't just flash the indicator, it turns itself off almost immediately after starting to record video"
positive,subjective,This camera is a fantastic camera - when it works
negative,objective,"- Wi-fi is kind of clunky, it offers a lot of options and it works, but setting it up for web services is tedious- requiring multiple steps on Canon's website and with Canon's CameraWindow software on your PC"
negative,subjective,That's kind of silly at this point when even cheaper cameras from other brands have this feature
negative,objective,- There's no true panorama mode - just an assist mode that requires you to stitch photos together later using software on your PC
negative,objective,"And your right finger naturally wants to sit on top of the power button, which is just to the right of the shutter button and looks and feels similar, so you'll often mistakenly turn off the camera when you are trying to take a photo"
negative,subjective,"- Dumb design: When you're holding the camera, your index fingers naturally end up in exactly the wrong positions - your left finger naturally wants to sit on top of the pop-up flash, which means it'll often fail to pop up and you'll get an error requirin"
negative,objective,"Turning it back on shows a full battery again, and it's happy to let me shoot dozens of stills without complaining"
negative,objective,"If I record anyway, it will automatically shut off after about a minute of recording"
negative,objective,"- Battery problems: Even after updating the firmware, I'm running into the same problem that others mentioned; the camera will show a full battery symbol until I start recording video, when it immediately shows the low battery warning"
negative,objective,"It was on the highest pixels and still was putting out a small, poor quality pictures"
negative,objective,This camera had trouble with focusing
negative,objective,If it is truly a hardware conflict no amount of firmware updates will correct the battery problem
negative,objective,"And the SX260 HS has the same zoom and other features but no Wi-Fi, which is no loss to me as"
negative,objective,But the battery problem ruins the entire package
negative,objective,As soon as I zoomed the battery indicator went from full to red empty
negative,subjective,From my recent experience the battery issue with this camera is not corrected
negative,objective,"According to the Canon website if the camera has the sixth digit of 3 or higher in the serial number, the camera should not have the battery issue"
negative,objective,I took the camera to Disney and went through 3 batteries and could only get 15 minutes max of video time on a fresh battery
negative,objective,I definitely miss the convenience of being able to just transfer the card to other devices
negative,objective,"I use the cord to get pictures off the camera now instead of removing the card, not my preferred way to handle my photos at all"
negative,objective,"I contacted Canon, they replaced the camera and were very quick about it, but the new one is still not perfect, and I am completely afraid to ever remove the memory card that's in there now because the new one also started having errors and issues with the card"
negative,objective,"After struggling with this for a couple of weeks, the memory card just stopped being accepted into the camera at all"
negative,subjective,I believe the camera even rendered one of  my cards completely unusable at all anymore
negative,objective,I tried several different memory cards from different manufacturers and still got errors
negative,subjective,"days and days worth of shots, gone"
negative,objective,I lost many pictures
negative,objective,Only a couple of months after purchase I started having memory card problems
negative,objective,"First of all, I paid almost $300 for mine, and now I see it for under $200"
negative,subjective,This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in Canon and I wonder if their quality control is slipping
negative,subjective,I was REALLY excited to get this one for the zoom feature
negative,subjective,"However, if you plan to use the video feature please don't buy"
negative,objective,"I tried again, then 30 seconds it shut down"
negative,objective,"It will take the video for about a minute or so, but then once I zoomed in it just shut down"
negative,objective,I tried taking video at a concert with the battery fully charged and had bad luck
positive,subjective,I really appreciate Amazon for agreeing to give a full refund even though I just missed the return period
negative,subjective,There is no way I will ever trust the Canon brand blindly before purchasing a product from them
negative,objective,"With such a pathetic battery drain experience when you try to take videos, and so many reviews and feedback in several forums from numerous customers I don't even understand why Canon hasn't begun to do damage control"
negative,objective,But what's the use when the battery system is so bad that it doesn't allow you take any videos at all
negative,objective,I usually have to restart the camera because the flash gets stuck half open due to my finger being in the way
negative,objective,But the flash pops out of the far left top side and I always have my finger there
positive,subjective,Especially at this price
positive,subjective,"It takes fantastic features, videos is great"
positive,subjective,This camera has great technical features
negative,subjective,"I just could noit use it comfortably and, I have been taking photos for many years"
negative,subjective,Viewing the photo you took with th live picture is awkward
negative,objective,Any adjustments will cause you to hit the movie button
negative,objective,To hold it to take a pictureand your finger holds the flash down
negative,subjective,The camera layout of controls is the poorest I have ever seen
negative,objective,"If you get this, make sure you buy extra batteries - real batteries not cheap replacements like I did"
negative,subjective,"Also, as many other reviews pointed out, the battery life is very poor"
negative,objective,I can't tell you the number of times I tried to take a picture and hit the on/off button instead of the shutter button
negative,objective,&amp; the flash pops up right were you hold it
negative,subjective,It hasn't worked well since I bought it
negative,objective,Finally went out this week and bought another due to this one always leaving us to not be able to take pictures
negative,subjective,Seems like you charge the battery and go to take pictures and the battery is dead
negative,subjective,Battery life is poor
negative,objective,Bought an extra battery as well
positive,subjective,the pictures and video are so nice from a point and shoot
negative,objective,"Looking through the Canon forums, there seems to be a design flaw with this camera and it is nothing that will be fixed through firmware (according to the posters in the forum)"
negative,objective,Taking video (videos look GREAT) will almost always shut the camera off
negative,objective,The firmware update did nothing to fix this problem and the issue gets worse and worse for me
negative,objective,BUT  the low battery indicator that shuts the camera off randomly completely ruins this camera's reliability (you can't take great pictures if the camera has no power)
positive,subjective,The photos are really fantastic
negative,subjective,Would have been an incredible camera had Canon not undershot the power capacity
positive,objective,"The camera does take some great pics - love the low-light sensitivity, the image stabilization and the 20x optical zoom"
negative,objective,Switching it back to still pics returns the battery level indication to normal
negative,objective,Makes the camera useless for any picture with a bright light source visible as it highlights the dust into big blurry dots
negative,objective,"Unfortunately, my SX280 now has a great deal of dust behind the lens"
negative,objective,- Dust intrusion - I've always carried my point and shoots in my glovebox
negative,objective,"Even in normal light situations, it just does not live up to the reviews I read before purchasing"
positive,objective,"I switched from Panasonic Lumix due to mechanical issues, but those pictures came out much clearer"
negative,objective,Still not using the wireless capabilities
negative,objective,Getting the required software for an Apple MacBook or an HP ChromeBook is practically impossible
negative,subjective,Too big to put in pocket
negative,subjective,DSLRs are out because of the bulk
negative,objective,I wanted to try to get a better optical zoom but I don't think this one can do it
negative,objective,"At my daughter's school play, about 40% of the photos were unfocused or slightly out of focus when taken on medium zoom (probably about 4-5x of the 8x range)"
negative,objective,"We had digital zoom off, which means we were using only optical zoom"
negative,objective,"I don't know if it was just our particular one or the model in general, but this one we had just would NOT focus with any quality at all when zoomed at all (optical, not digital)"
negative,objective,Finally traced it back to a day last week when I installed the Canon software
negative,subjective,My computer slowed down considerably
negative,subjective,Would not buy this style - very fragile camera
negative,objective,Neither close when camera is turned off
negative,objective,"When on switch is pressed only one side lens opens then with me help, I slide the other open"
negative,objective,Opened up case after storing in Amazon purchased case just for camera and found lens covers had become jamb
negative,objective,Used it for three months and I received average photos
negative,objective,I called the Cannon company customer service and he couldn't figure it out either
negative,objective,This camera is NOT user friendly and mine will not even take pictures with a flash mode on
negative,objective,I don't know what these people are doing that I am not but this is the most difficult menu I ever had to figure out
negative,subjective,I feel like every picture that I take with this camera comes out blurry
positive,objective,Our old Elph took beautiful crisp pictures
negative,objective,Later when I downloaded the picture it was very grainy and orange as if the flash didn't quite reach the target
negative,objective,"I used the timer and auto flash, which did go off"
negative,objective,"Not only does this cause a frequent loss of the picture you want, but also leads to a lot of blurry photos because it's hard to hold perfectly still while waiting for the picture to snap a full second after pressing the button"
negative,objective,"Even after the half press to get the focus first, the full press took a long time to actually snap the shot"
negative,objective,I kept missing the shot I wanted because it took nearly a second to actually snap the picture after pressing the button
negative,subjective,My first observation was how slow it was to take a picture after pressing the button
negative,subjective,"In fact, as I am writing this, I had to reduce my star rating from 2 to 1 as this is making me re-live my frustration again"
negative,objective,"Multiply that time to wait to take a photo or to take more than 1 photo by 5 to 8 times when in flash mode, and if you try and push the shutter too quickly (like within 2 seconds after flash) you will normally have to back up and try again"
negative,objective,"It may only be 2-3 seconds in real life, but when you are taking a lot of photos, it is very slow"
negative,objective,"Also, when you want to take a photo, it seems like an eternity to actually take it"
positive,subjective,"Bought a Kodak 12 years ago with less megapixiels, but what a better result"
negative,subjective,Far from good quality
negative,objective,Image also carries the pixel so it is not only on LCD
negative,objective,However 3 out of 4 turned out with center dead pixel
positive,subjective,Amazon had fantastic offer on the prices so I had purchased 4 camera to give as gift (2 gray and 2 red)
negative,subjective,I finally returned it for a refund and will not consider getting another Canon product
negative,subjective,Too many variations in accessing different functions
negative,subjective,The operating buttons were small and crammed together making them hard to access
negative,objective,"Spent hours trying to make the connections and never was able to do so to my phone, receiving an unresolvable &#34;bugging&#34; message that stopped me cold"
negative,subjective,"I know point and shoot will never be as good as a DSLR, but my phone takes better pictures than this"
negative,subjective,Not that sharp and the colors don't seem accurate
negative,objective,"The camera has many interesting features I didn't even think a P&S; camera could have (AE lock, AF lock among others) but those don't matter when the most important feature, taking a decent photo, is lacking"
negative,subjective,I think Canon is aware that all the silver cameras are bad and that's why they lowered the price
negative,subjective,I was wondering why the gray model sells for $150 and the silver one I bought only $88
negative,objective,Apparently I am not the only one who complains about the yellowish tint so it's not that I was unlucky to get a bad camera
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately, I've got a bad camera that shows a yellowish tint in every single picture, especially those taken indoors"
positive,subjective,To be honest I was pretty impressed with the A2500 model (see my review on Canon A2500) and I thought if I can get the PowerShot ELPH 130 who has pretty much the same features as A2500 but had 8x optical zoom instead of 5x it will be even better
negative,objective,The brand new camera worked for 31 days then became total useless - the images were corrupted
negative,subjective,"Daytime pictures are good enough for a low end camera, but the night time pictures were terrible"
positive,objective,"However , Canon has promised to repair at no cost"
negative,objective,LCD display has failed after 3 months use
negative,subjective,If you want to take pictures of landscape or portraits get a better camera
negative,subjective,I did not like the no zoom at all on this camera
negative,subjective,I've messed around with the settings multiple times and every photo comes out with poor color saturation
positive ,subjective,;  My wife wanted to take better photos than her iPhone and also to replace her old 4 year old SD1200
negative,subjective,Would send it back or out for repair but it just isn't worth the aggravation
negative,subjective,"Also, at times when turning it camera on, the entire itself screen one complete blur (for maybe 10-20 seconds) and then it focuses correctly"
negative,subjective,"Yes, I knew this before purchasing, but from the reviews, I mistakenly thought it was quick enough for at least some action shots"
negative,objective,There is no way to adjust the shutter speed
negative,subjective,"Pictures come out blurry, even if they are in slow action"
negative,subjective,I regret buying this camera because it just doesn't &#34;snap&#34; the object quick enough
positive,subjective,"Small, lightweight camera"
negative,subjective,I am having the unit returned and I will purchase a competitive product with better capabilities for $90
negative,objective,I then called the customer service organization and the best they would do is offer me a 20% discount
negative,objective,The Canon service center wanted to charge me $50 to replace something that I paid about $150 for a little more than a year ago
negative,objective,"They do not repair these units but instead, replace them"
negative,objective,I had to send the unit in for repair
negative,objective,I called tech support and tried to talk to them and the best they would do was 20% off
negative,objective,I paid about $150 for it when I got it
negative,subjective,They received the unit yesterday and today I got an email that said for $50 they would send me a refurbished one
negative,objective,Since Canon does not do RMAs I had to pay for shipping (if it fits it ships for $5)
negative,objective,"A few months ago vertical lines started showing up in the display, it got worse over time (See photo) and last week I finally contacted Canon tech support, after a few emails and sending them a picture of what the display looked like they said I would have to send it in for repair"
positive,objective,"It was stored in it's own protective case, in my back pack"
positive,objective,"It was not &#34;heavily&#34; used, mostly to take pictures of white boards in meetings and the occasional use on vacations"
positive ,objective,"One star because the actual image was not effected, one star because I really did like it when it worked"
negative,subjective,Good pics but flash pictures take way too long to 'take
negative,subjective,Performance is unacceptable
negative,objective,"I have to shut it down, wait few minutes and then works again"
negative,objective,"After several months of use, every so often the camera does not work"
negative,subjective,macro did not give good resolution - went with Nikon Coolpix P300 - more rugged and high resolution
positive,subjective,I have two Canon cameras that I used till problems developed and I liked them a lot
negative,subjective,It's my own fault for not reading more of the description and being unpleasantly surprised when the camera came with a rechargeable battery and NO USB cable
negative,objective,I've tried all the different settings but the pictures are grainy
negative,subjective,"Not up to Canon standards of past, very disapointed, was returned"
negative,objective,It is the same amount of money I paid for the camera
negative,objective,Canon emailed back and told us to pay $140
negative,objective,The telescoping zoom lens is unable to extend and is stuck
negative,objective,No physical manual
negative,objective,No USB cable
positive,subjective,"The zoom is nice, I guess, which is mostly why I bought it"
negative,objective,The settings and options don't help much
negative,subjective,"I'm not a good photographer, so maybe that has something to do with it, but this camera just doesn't work for me"
negative,subjective,"But after trying many times, all the photos took by this tiny camera were even vaguer than what I got by using iphone 5"
negative,subjective,I wanted to love this camera but the picture quality just isn't there for me
negative,subjective,Not very user friendly for the novice
negative,subjective,I would not recommend buying it if you are looking for a point-and-shoot
negative,subjective,"By &#34;crappy&#34; I mean, it pretty much doesn't take [peer shot"
negative,subjective,Pretty crappy when taking action shots
negative,subjective,A great deal of searching with many out of focus shots
negative,subjective,Macro close ups were no better
negative,objective,The lens seems to be constantly searching with green focus squares popping up in various parts of the lens field but almost never dead center
negative,objective,90% of my shots were out of focus
negative,objective,My telephoto target is a bird feeding station about 15 feet away I would also try to capture birds in tree branches about 25 to 30 feet away
negative,objective,Auto Focus Problems:
positive,subjective,I purchased the Canon in part because of the highly rated reviews on several professional websites and the 50 power telephoto lens system
negative,objective,This one the buttons on the right side of the camera are too touch sensitive and I have repeatly hit the timer button or the REC button when trying to take a regular picture and have missed the picture opportunity
negative,subjective,That camera I just plain wore out with constant use
negative,subjective,Too bad Kodak got out of the game too early they were far and above when it comes to the point and shoot
negative,subjective,"I bought the Canon 60D camera before this one and was so pleased I was expecting the same quality in the point and shoot, and it is definitely not there"
negative,subjective,Everything looks far away
negative,objective,"Also,the photos are much smaller when you download them"
negative,subjective,The only way to get a good shot is in the auto mode with the green auto symbol and then you can only take one shot at a time
negative,objective,"When zooming in with the camera on the sport symbol, the camera is continually zooming in and out and will not stay focused so all your action shots are blurry"
negative,objective,"Plus, I am always mistakenly going to the wrong button, thus missing some great video"
negative,subjective,POOR DESIGN
negative,objective,"Cons: hitting buttons while taking simple photos, very frustrating having to turn off things you never intended on using"
negative,subjective,I plan to put some rubber with adhesive (used for the bottom of chairs) to help alleviate the problem of hitting the self timer EVERY TIME
negative,subjective,POOR DESIGN - SELF TIMER KEEPS GETTING HIT
negative,objective,Zoom  tends to sticks when zooming in or zooming out
negative,objective,Can hardly see through the viewfinder to compose your picture
negative,objective,The camera will not focus rapidly enough to catch fast moving images
negative,subjective,Auto-focus does a poor job
negative,subjective,Auto mode is pretty much useless
negative,subjective,Placement of buttons may cause the user to accidentally hit one causing the camera to behave in an unexpected manner
positive,subjective,It might be a good camera for someone who wanted a camera that has a good telephoto plus a wide angle without carrying a couple of lenses
positive,subjective,I was looking for something small to fit in my purse
negative,subjective,Unfortunately I ordered this camera thinking it was a lot smaller than it actually was
negative,subjective,Disappointed in the limited aperture range of F3
negative,objective,"But, yesterday the camera froze and stopped working all together"
negative,subjective,I have been using settings that do not ever use flash to avoid the problem
negative,subjective,"Regardless, about a month ago the flash started going off even when closed and would make  a horrible &#34;spark&#34; sound"
negative,subjective,"The zoom is the only real reason to buy, but really the last model with slightly less zoom took much better pictures"
negative,objective,We sent back not wanting to mess with getting fixed as we had less than a month
negative,objective,After using it for 2 weeks we find out the eye view window is recalled due to wrong chemical placed in plastic
positive,subjective,Camera takes very good pictures
negative,objective,"I have not even taken the camera out of the box, and I have already been notified of a dangerous problem with this model camera"
negative,subjective,"Was not happy with the zoom, did not surpass my Nikon Coolpix P51 with a 42 time zoom"
negative,objective,From what I've read they glue on the Lens
negative,subjective,"My guess is something is stuck behind the lens enclosure, whether its sand or something else"
negative,objective,Why build something that you can never repair
negative,objective,They DO NOT repair them but replace them completely
positive,objective,All the craters of the moon were visible at 50x zoom and auto settings
negative,objective,"Yes, this camera may have been defective, but I don't want to take the chance that replacing it with an identical one wouldn't do the same 6 months from now"
negative,objective,"I found out that ""Lens Error"" is very common with Canon Powershots and that Canon typically blames it on user error (like dust, sand, or dropping it)"
negative,objective,It would only fully retract when the lens was fully set at 24mm wide angle setting
negative,objective,"The only remedy I found was to take the battery out, wait about a minute, then put it back in and it would usually retract the lens"
negative,objective,"When I tried to turn it off, I got ""Lens Error, Restart Camera"""
positive,objective,Fully charged the battery and took some pictures to test it out
negative,subjective,How does Canon explain the service manual
negative,objective,It can only stream from memory
negative,subjective,Called Canon Tech Support and guess what: this camera cannot live stream
negative,objective,"It does not work, with any of the cabling diagrams in the service manual, and I have all the cables if you see my Amazon orders list"
negative,objective,Live streaming does not work
negative,objective,"I've used many digital cameras for years, and this is not the first defect I have encountered, but it is the first time I had one that just stopped displaying what it saw"
negative,objective,Be sure to keep all of your paperwork and be ready to send it in for replacement when the time comes
negative,subjective,"I recommend that if you want this camera that you buy an extended warranty with it, since repair is apparently not an option"
negative,subjective,and was working well until it suddenly stopped
negative,objective,"The reason for my lower rating here is that my camera suddenly stopped working a few weeks out of the warranty period (black screen), and Canon would not repair it, but offered to sell me a replacement"
negative,objective,"It's hard to use manual focus, and you need to know the custom settings to make this well for your applications"
positive,objective,"I have recommended this very versatile camera to several people, because it is a great buy for the 50x features"
negative,subjective,the raw feature is useless&#8230; I've had it a week now and no one has been able to make the raw files visible
negative,objective,Only get this camera if you plan to shoot jpg only&#8230;
negative,subjective,pretty useless and put a real damper on being excited about looking at the images you take
negative,objective,No one knows how to make the CR2 files work on Adobe&#8230;
positive ,subjective,"The camera itself is super, but if you want to shoot raw and have photoshop and bridge, forget this little guy"
negative,objective,"After having a real DSL the picture quality was sub-par, so I exchanged for the Canon EOS Rebel in white"
negative,subjective,Zoom is pretty bad
negative,objective,"Also, takes a while for the flash to charge"
positive,objective,"My old PowerShot adjust automatically, and I was just buying this one as back up since it was so reasonably priced, but will be returning it"
negative,objective,This camera does not automatically adjust to Macro and the macro button is not convenient on the back of the camera to switch to it easily
negative,objective,"I also miss a quick way to switch shooting modes via the little dial-wheel, but now I must stop and click on the Func button then click around until I find the appropriate setting"
negative,subjective,So much less control which is not cool
negative,objective,The only setting is one for 'Super Vivid'
negative,objective,Apparently it doesn't have a way to adjust the colors like on older models
negative,objective,"After reading so many rave reviews, I was really surprised to see the photos that weren't at all sharp, and so poor compared to my other cameras"
negative,objective,Was not what we were looking for and there was this annoying delay when taking pictures
negative,objective,I find myself always reaching for the outdated model rather than this one
negative,objective,There is a great delay while the flash charges and the camera seems to take forever to right to the the card
negative,objective,"I have tried to use faster cards and lower compression and most fully charged batteries, but I can't get the pictures to come out as sharp as with my other cameras"
negative,objective,This camera just doesn't mange to keep up with my picture taking needs
negative,subjective,I was more than a bit disappointed to learn that it DID NOT COME WITH A FREE SD CARD as advertised
negative,objective,She was afraid to use it without the memory card
negative,objective,Can't really judge the camera because it came without the memory disc promised with the purchase
negative,subjective,But the camera feels very cheap
negative,subjective,It is very light and seems like it could break easily
negative,subjective,I also think the camera feels like it is cheaply built
negative,subjective,"Maybe I had a defective camera, but I could not get it to take a sharply focused shot, even in good light"
negative,subjective,I tried this for a few days and it simply did not work correctly
negative,objective,It doesn't come with much in the way of operator instructions included with the camera
negative,objective,I have to replace batteries and I've only used the camera a few times since receiving it less than a week ago
negative,subjective,The color is pretty blah
negative,objective,there was no SD card as it was mentioned in the description of the product
negative,objective,the camera came without a charger
negative,subjective,I would consider a rechargeable battery next time
negative,subjective,"perhaps it should be listed as a little ladies camera and definitely not, for old farts, with huge  restricted hands"
negative,objective,I can't even touch the tiny little buttons on the camera
negative,subjective,This camera is so small I can not hold it in my hands
negative,subjective,I take lots of pictures and do not find this camera well made
negative,objective,"It takes a lot of pressure to close the lid and the elongated design has the narrow end next to the hinge, where most of the pressure is applied"
negative,subjective,The lid and hinge are flimsy and poorly designed
negative,subjective,have sent it back to repair facility twice already
negative,subjective,no quality control
negative,objective,Not a camera for the kids or wives who just want a 'point and shoot' and not have to worry about anything else
negative,objective,"Lot of shots were out of focus, people walking onto stage during an awards program"
negative,objective,"All shots were taken indoors so that may be the problem, the lighting and all"
negative,subjective,"well, the pictures that did come out okay are too grainy and cannot be enlarged without extreme distortion"
negative,objective,The pictures from my SD450 will blow this so called 16MP away
negative,objective,No recharging batteries and 16MP would blow my SD450 away
negative,subjective,The battery is bad so instead of ordering a new battery I thought this camera with &#34;16MP&#34; and 2 AA batteries would be great
negative,subjective,"Whether or not that's a Canon, I cannot say, as the only Canon I have gotten lately is an SLR which is fine"
negative,objective,"If you just want something to set on &#34;auto&#34; and shoot away with reckless abandon, or need something you can put at risk of getting broken, lost, or stolen, then pick one of these up as either a backup or just basic snapshots (beach vacations come to mind)"
negative,subjective,"Finding settings in the annoying on-screen menu takes forever, as opposed to past models with wheels or buttons for critical functions that you want to access and use quickly"
negative,subjective,"I would take one of my old, clunky, &#34;low&#34; megapixel Canons over a dozen of this model any day"
negative,subjective,"Pictures are not great, but will do as long as you have plenty of light"
positive,subjective,"The only redeeming features (note I did not say &#34;qualities&#34;) aside from the price are the optical viewfinder (yes, you can acually LOOK through the camera to set up a shot) and it's use of off-the-shelf batteries (AA)"
negative,subjective,"Sadly, I am not terribly happy with it, the only concession being it was at a giveaway price ($60)"
negative,subjective,no view finder makes it useless to me used it for a gift
negative,subjective,Picture quality is far from stellar
negative,subjective,"When I looked at the pictures it took, I wasn't very impressed"
negative,subjective,Was not real user friendly older version was better and easyer to use
positive,subjective,"However, when it actually works, the pictures are really good quality (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1)"
negative,subjective,"Takes too long to actually capture the image (long shutter lag), and image is often very blurry"
negative,subjective,"My wife bought this for a quick fix to a camera she lost, it's just a space taker now - working junk I couldn't even give away"
negative,subjective,"This camera does not take good pictures, every once in a while we get one with no problems, but far an few between"
negative,subjective,Camera takes very poor grainy photos in regular room light even with flash on
negative,subjective,The optical viewfinder does not accurately display what is being photographed
negative,subjective,"She swore it was fine and that she didn't want me to return it, but I've noticed now that she still almost always uses her old camera over the new one, which makes my purchase a complete waste of money since I was trying to upgrade her camera, not downgrade"
negative,subjective,It reminds me of the cheap cameras I had as a kid 20+ years ago
negative,subjective,We noticed within minutes of her trying to snap photos of my daughters opening their gifts that the flash was extremely slow to charge
positive ,objective,"I immediately noticed the camera was very lightweight and made of plastic, which gave an immediate impression of being cheap quality, but I was willing to overlook that since all that really matters is performance"
positive,subjective,"When the box arrived, I pulled the camera out just to make sure it was in good shape and to see what it looked like"
negative,subjective,Zoom does not always work
negative,subjective,It does not take clear pictures
positive ,objective,"It's there for good, and it's even noticeable when viewing an image on my computer at 50% of its original size"
positive ,objective,"Appearance wise, the camera looks nice"
negative,subjective,"If you can get this for a great price, then maybe as a camera of last resort"
negative,subjective,it's both grainy and lacking into detail as processing smears stuff
negative,subjective,"The image quality is really all that I was concerned about, and it's not good"
negative,subjective,The problem is that the quality is simply bad
positive,subjective,"The zoom is nice, and honestly a few years ago an 8x zoom on a camera this size would be breathtaking"
positive,subjective,"Its small, but again next to a camera in gadgets many of us already carry, it's got to add value"
negative,subjective,I prefer to not have to re-learn another company's menu system
negative,subjective,"But this one has too much lag time until shutter goes, and I use it at a very low MP setting (16"
negative,subjective,The build got worse by model
negative,subjective,It does not work as well as my old one did
negative,subjective,do not be hoodwinked by megapixels and branded lens
negative,subjective,it only serves to create noise at high iso
positive,objective,dont be tempted by the high pixels cramped into a tiny sensor
positive ,objective,"I was tempted by the zeiss lens, high zoom and low price"
negative,subjective,both cameras lack image stabilization and have smaller sensors and lower pixe count
negative,subjective,worse picture quality than my 5 megapixel samsung phone camera
negative,subjective,Only problem is that the pictures are not good
positive,subjective,Its good for taking close up pics
negative,subjective,Also picture quality is not good when you xoom 50%
negative,subjective,Cons: takes forever to focus; pictures are often out of focus especially need to quickly snap a shot
positive,subjective,charges quickly
positive,objective,8x optical zoom
positive,subjective,"Pros: very small, easily fits in pocket"
negative,objective,We BOTH complain that our pictures are almost always blurry no matter how still you hold it
negative,subjective,I have never had worse quality pictures than with this camera
negative,subjective,Disappointed that image quality is not better
negative,subjective,Images at long zoom ranges are generally of poor quality
negative,subjective,Purchased and returned because the image quality is not as good as Sony's HX100 which I own
negative,subjective,"I believe the camera is a fairly good camera, but not for the price, and not for my use"
negative,objective,"I saw a note about not having owner/user manuals that could be downloaded, but I had no trouble downloading one from Sony that I could store on my computer or print as I needed"
negative,objective,"In addition, the image software that I downloaded from Sony will not allow me to choose where the image is stored, but only in the default location"
negative,objective,"To my dismay The EVF is such a low resolution that it is barely useable for normal photography, and useless for focusing, framing, etc"
negative,subjective,"Poor quality pictures, mostly blurry if any action"
negative,objective,"Tip: with Nikon D3200 priced $100 more(D3200 also failed to take better pictures than my H50 after 10 days of trial) and Sony A65 priced $200 more, the HX300 seems seriously overpriced"
negative,subjective,In my case it just did not meet the expectations
negative,objective,"Tried different settings, no better results at all"
negative,subjective,however is unable to take better pictures
positive,subjective,During testing found a quite powerful and easy to use camera; the manual focus is handy and works very well
positive,objective,"1 MP, Super Steady Shot)"
negative,objective,Screen stuck on language setting as soon as I turned it on
negative,objective,Even online tech support couldn't help
positive,subjective,The version with 30x zoom is much better in overall quality
negative,subjective,This camera only lasted me 6 months before it got all glitchy and sad
positive,subjective,"It is a great product, but I received it missing some accessories as the rechargeable battery, the USB and charge cable and the protection lens strip"
negative,subjective,"If you're looking to take action shots of your kids or pets, this is likely not the camera for you"
negative,subjective,I was surprised not to see more reviews about the slow writing speed on line when I was researching
positive,objective,"And this is with use of a ScanDisk HD 32GB/80 MB card, the fastest available"
negative,objective,"Certainly, you can set it to burst mode and take multiple shots with one click, but then you still have to wait 3-4 seconds for it to write before you can initiate the next burst"
negative,objective,"5 second delay between the time you snap the photo and the time it's its ready for the next shot (in other words, the writing speed or how long it takes the image to record onto the memory card) is unacceptable"
negative,subjective,I would not recommend this camera to photographers who care about the quality of the images
negative,subjective,It doesn't tell you how to get it off of digital zoom
negative,subjective,The manual that comes with it sucks
negative,subjective,"I owned the HX200 but it broke a week after buying it, was repaired, then broke again at 14 months (out of warrantee) and they said it would cost $160 to fix"
negative,subjective,The other models felt more solid in the hand
negative,subjective,I use the peep site all of the time so it is ok for me but I wouldn't want to have to hold it out from my eye for any length of time
negative,subjective,The body is bulky and very light which makes it awkward to hold
negative,subjective,This camera is so slow recording the images on zoom that I can only get one shot where as on the others I could get 5
negative,objective,They also eliminated the option of using the flash on other than auto
negative,objective,It does a poor job on photos with artificial light
negative,subjective,I have made a couple of good close-ups of frogs but when you use the zoom the photos seem fake
negative,subjective,Also everyone knows that you should never plug your camera directly a wall outlet or computer as the chance of damage to the camera is huge
negative,subjective,Having the camera sitting on the floor (the cord is too short to reach other outlets) with a large dog in the house is asking for trouble
negative,objective,The 300 can only be charged through the camera
positive,subjective,All of my other Sonys were designed with a charger so that you could charge the battery out of the camera
negative,objective,Also as a bird and wildlife photographer I always carry extra charged batteries
negative,objective,I have to fumble with the lens cap to get it off of the 300
positive,subjective,It makes it fast to grab your camera a shoot moving birds
negative,objective,That is the lens cap falling off when you turn the camera on
negative,subjective,"Either way if you are a serious photographer I doubt if you will think it good enough, especially at its current price"
positive,subjective,"Summary: if telephoto is your priority, yes, if macro no"
positive,subjective,On the positive side the 50x zoom is awesome
negative,subjective,I felt that the camera was controlling me not vice versa
negative,objective,"Secondly, being used to an older generation of camera,  I struggled with the fact that it is 100% computerised"
negative,subjective,"My biggest complaint is that it only stops up to f8 which makes it virtually useless as a macro, even if you buy a macro lens and because the standard lens is not unscrewable, your choice is very limited"
negative,subjective,This is cheap plastic
negative,subjective,I stopped buying anything Sony years ago because the quality was just never there
negative,subjective,Processing of shots was unbearably slow
negative,subjective,The LCD image was invisible in bright light and shooting outdoors
negative,subjective,It is not optimal for video from a distance
negative,objective,"The vide only had a 10x zoom, so we returned it"
negative,subjective,While it worked it was only so-so
negative,objective,"The screen rarely works, I have had more blurry pictures with this camera than I ever had with my Canon that I had for almost 4 years"
negative,objective,I bought this camera less than a year ago and I can't see what I am taking a picture of anymore
negative,subjective,"It is a shame in this day and age that you can't buy a camera that is simple to use, takes good picture all the time along with decent video"
negative,objective,You have to use anti-shake setting or you get blurred photos but if you use that setting you don't get all the other auto adjustment features
negative,objective,And then I found out the software doesn't work on 64 bit PC so spent 2 days looking for solutions
positive,subjective,"Also, the video function seems fine, expect, it has a delay prior to starting after you hit record - and what I like about sony is you can zoom why you record"
positive ,subjective,"anyway, I really like the camera, but what good is it , if you miss the picture you are trying to take"
negative,subjective,"I hope sony will update the firmwarre to maybe fix this, but not seen many digital cameras get updates like that, or maybe I just need to play with the settings more"
negative,subjective,"For a camera this expensive, it is a ridiculous problem"
negative,objective,Then you can only take a small amount of photos without a memory card
negative,objective,I understand eventually they won't work at all
negative,subjective,"Just replace memory cards, if you are lucky they will work for 3 months"
negative,objective,There is nothing you can do to fix this as far as I can tell on the Internet and Sony site
negative,objective,problem with the camera is that it is constantly having memory card issues
negative,objective,"However, I have replaced the memory card (all with Sony brand) at least 4, I think 5, times now since purchasing this camera"
positive,subjective,Update: Love this camera and the quality of images
negative,objective,The camera does NOT come with one and only has internal memory that can store about 9 photos at highest quality without one
negative,subjective,Flash is also too aggressive and couldn't get nice pictures as I used to with previous versions of Cyber shots
positive,subjective,Battery life is also very good and zoom works OK too
negative,objective,"Video recording is not good, it doesn't have auto focus so when you move the camera it goes out of focus, refocusing when you reach the subjectiveect and don't move"
negative,objective,"it takes a lot to turn on, load and focus, it even takes the pictures if you push the camera too hard and accepts them as OK without them being focused"
positive,subjective,The GPS works very well and it is easy to operate
negative,subjective,I decided to buy Lumix camera for the similar price and it will be better
negative,subjective,picture quality was below my expectation
negative,objective,"It came with dust in the lens, but i did not realize it until it was too late therefore i could not exchange or replace it"
negative,objective,"I have an older Nikon camera that's a 4 megapixel, and it takes much better pictures"
negative,subjective,"I don't know if this is a problem with this particular camera, but anything we took a picture of that had a lot of white in it (like white tents) there was this weird halo/cloudy effect"
negative,objective,One requirement for this camera was that it take pictures indoors in low light--and it couldn't at all
negative,subjective,"Most frustrating was that when I took pictures indoors, the pictures were really grainy, and the focus just couldn't get very sharp"
negative,objective,"When we used pictures using the zoom, the pictures were grainy"
negative,objective,It seemed like the camera kept focusing on objects in the background instead of the background
negative,objective,The pictures we took outdoors on a cloudy day didn't turn out well
negative,objective,I tried manual settings with the Sony also and the end result was no different
negative,objective,"My previous camera did require settings to be changed manually but if the automatic features goof up the shot, what's the point of the technology"
negative,subjective,The pictures are very grainy in low light or even medium light
negative,subjective,After a few days and well over 100 pictures I have to say I'm really disappointed
positive ,objective,"I've had the DSC-H20 for less than a day and there's a huge improvement in image quality, features and ease of use"
negative,objective,"BTW, the software is not compatible with Mac, although my Kodak Easy Share software recognised the memory stick and had no trouble connecting the device"
negative,subjective,The file size made for slow loading  onto the computer
negative,objective,"Thirdly, the 12MP is too much for this camera to handle, it didn't seem to know what to do with all those pixels"
negative,subjective,I never felt like i was in control of this camera
negative,objective,And the pixel noise was over the top
negative,objective,"The camera took forever to find a focal point, then the pix still wouldn't be sharp"
negative,subjective,"Secondly, the focus (or lack therof) is terrible"
negative,subjective,I shoot mostly candid shots of ppl and this camera was a real letdown
negative,subjective,But for me it just didn't take GOOD PICTURES
positive,subjective,The features are also easy to use
positive,subjective,) and the burst feature is great
positive,subjective,"On the positive side, I liked it's looks ("
negative,subjective,Please don't waste your money here
negative,objective,"Perhaps I received a defective model, or all these reviewers have either never had a digital camera in their life or have yet to upload the photos they've taken to their computer"
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately we are back to the drawing board now looking into purchasing a Canon, with $300 down the drain"
negative,objective,"When uploaded and viewed on your TV or computer, the frames per second looks choppy"
negative,subjective,The video isn't as good either
negative,subjective,"The photos are blurry, have shadows, rain and glares galore"
negative,subjective,"You 'think' the photos are crisp when viewed on the live viewer, however once uploaded, you see a slightly different reality"
negative,subjective,"1mpx, does not deliver quality photos nor does it stabilize images"
negative,objective,So you need to buy a memory card Price Jack up again
negative,objective,Second problem is that is comes with enough internal memory to take two pictures
negative,objective,This jacks the price up one step
negative,objective,With its own special battery you need to buy a spare just in case the battery dies since you can't just run into 7-11 and pick up a spare
positive,subjective,This camera while it does take excellent photos has its down sides
negative,subjective,"I'm shopping again, and praying this noise issue isn't inherent in all 12MP cameras"
negative,objective,I had the same problem taking pics at a church event
negative,objective,"In anything resembling normal indoor light, let alone low light, the images came out blurry, out of focus, and filled with noise"
negative,objective,"However, once I brought those flowers inside and put them in a vase, I couldn't get a decent shot using ANY of the myriad settings, with flash or without"
positive,subjective,"And when I was outside taking pictures of the roses in my landscape in bright sunlight, the images were gorgeously vivid and lush"
positive,objective,"Yes, there are a TON of fancy features, including exotic things like a smile sensor and true HD video"
positive,subjective,"Video performance of the W290 was good indoors and out, but I have a Canon videocamera so I didn't give that feature much weight"
negative,objective,The P93A only recognizes 1 gigabit of memory
positive,objective,"Pack two spares and you could tour the world if you exploited the second advantage, the ability of the W290 to use multigigabit memory sticks"
positive,subjective,One is the excellent battery life
negative,objective,The W290 produced only 2 images out of forty worth saving
positive,subjective,"l megapixel P93A produced excellent, sharp pictures of fast-moving four-year-olds"
negative,objective,"All settings of automatic and manual focus, with and without flash, produce very soft, dark images"
negative,objective,"HOWEVER, bring it indoors and it doesn't perform anywhere near as well as my old 5"
positive,objective,The color rendition has the usual pleasing Sony balance
positive,objective,The 28mm equivalent end of the lens travel produces some nice panoramic shots
positive,objective,"1 megapixel DSC-W290 with its wide-angle zoom lens does reasonably well,  The 'Steadyshot' feature helps at max zoom"
negative,objective,"It is a very easy camera to use and I liked the larger viewing window, but I was only happy with the photos taken in sunny light outdoors"
positive,subjective,"I really wanted to like the Sony camera, because we are extremely happy with our Sony HDTV"
negative,objective,"Recently, the flash stopped working, so I went looking for another camera"
positive,subjective,"However, until recently the photos on the Canon were very nice, colorful and crisp"
negative,subjective,) the picture quality is VERY POOR
negative,objective,I wish this camera had a smarter ISO auto-ajustment
negative,subjective,"High ISO yields bad quality pictures, because the idea is to obtain a brighter picture in low light conditions"
negative,subjective,Too bad I didn't know much about the ISO settings before buying this camera
negative,subjective,But I was really disappointed when taking pictures in-doors
positive,subjective,Amazing video capture
positive,subjective,"For out-doors picture, with good light conditions, the pictures are great and sharp"
negative,objective,This camera is probably good for a beginner but not for any one who wants to take pictures of anything that might move
positive ,objective,I am sorry I bought the camera - I should have known that the low price was too good to be true
negative,objective,The automatic features are nice in some situations but when I am trying to take picture of my grandchildren they often cause me to miss the shot
negative,objective,The biggest disappoint is the lag time in taking pictures
negative,subjective,it's a camera--it's supposed to take good photos
negative,subjective,This camera takes the softest photos I've seen in its class
negative,subjective,"If you want anything bigger than that, or expect to crop and zoom out of full-size images, then forget it"
positive,subjective,Will it be fine for 4x6 and 5x7 images
negative,objective,EVERY image taken with the DSC-W290 is grainy
negative,objective,"Yeah, it's $90 more, but I think that's more than worth it to correct the Sony's horrible indoor picture quality--plus the DMC-ZS3 adds a TON of extra features (and 12x zoom)"
negative,subjective,I could hardly salvage any photos that could be printed above 5x7 because the noise is so bad
negative,subjective,"Unless you're taking indoor photos in a room lit with insanely bright light, then expect to get tons of noise in your photos"
negative,subjective,This camera isn't good value for the money
positive,subjective,viewing them at reduced size everything looked fantastic
negative,subjective,"Basically, in closing, this camera is worthless unless you just want some flashy looking toy that you can maybe take non-action pictures outside on sunny days with"
negative,objective,"the flash went off (it was on ""easy mode"") and still she motion blurred AND out of focus, this is just unacceptable"
negative,subjective,"Most recently, I tried to take a picture of my girlfriend moving her head while in the bleachers at a stadium at night with all the stadium lights on"
negative,objective,Medium light action shots are impossible
negative,subjective,"I've tried center focus, multifocus, etc and nothing seems to help"
negative,objective,"It's always confused, zooming the focus in and out trying to pick out whatever is in the foreground"
negative,objective,I've taken more out of focus pictures in the past 4 months than the past 4 years
negative,subjective,That's not the worst part though; the autofocus of this camera is worthless
negative,subjective,The low-light performance if this camera is really bad though
positive,subjective,The W290's daylight performance is acceptable
negative,subjective,The image quality is AWFUL
positive,objective,"This is basically the same thing that Cannon does, but my old Sony camera used a standard mini-usb style plug and I could plug the charger directly into the cam without removing the battery"
negative,objective,This camera uses a proprietary plug to attach to the computer and requires an external battery charger
positive,subjective,"I used the lanyard from my previous camera, and it works great"
negative,objective,The mode selection wheel often turns its self in my pocket or backpack and I find myself taking videos instead of pictures too often
negative,subjective,I feel it's a bit hard to push with my big paw sized hands
negative,objective,The shutter button is oblong and apparently confuses people
negative,objective,"There's the goofy ""smile detection"" button on the top, as well as on/off and shutter"
negative,objective,"Whenever I hand this camera to someone to take a picture of me, they are ALWAYS confused by the buttons"
negative,objective,"There's no viewfinder, and the screen doesn't work very well in direct sunlight"
positive,objective,It's slightly larger than some other point and shoot's but it's also mostly screen
positive,subjective,"Size is good for me, but I'm a guy and have big pockets"
negative,objective,It doesn't work while recording a video but that's not really a big deal to me
positive,subjective,"The zoom works as expected, nothing good or bad to report"
positive,subjective,"The camera is fast, or at least I've not noticed it being slow which is a welcome change from my previous camera"
positive,subjective,"Feature wise, this camera has plenty"
positive,objective,"Kudos to Sony on this one, I've charged the battery 3-4 times since I've owned the camera"
positive,subjective,Battery life is outstanding
positive,subjective,Everyone that uses this camera comments on how big and nice the display is
positive,subjective,"The display is huge, and easy to see things in"
positive,subjective,It is so much better than the video taken from W50
positive,subjective,One good thing I like about this is the HD video
positive,objective,"After using it for more than half a year, I stumbled upon something: if I use the EASY mode (I always thought it's for senior citizens because for one thing the fonts are huge), the photos are much better than the more advanced mode"
negative,objective,Photos are usually grainy and always seem a little out-of-focus
negative,subjective,"But to my greatest surprise and disappointment, W290 takes photos that are much worse than W50"
positive,subjective,Many of my friends were surprised to find out I used a point-and-shoot for taking photos for my first child because the photos were very sharp and well focused (without using flash on the baby)
negative,subjective,Youn think you get the best but you are wrong do not buy this camera I used to have a nikon and got this sony now I have lots of problems to put my videos
positive,subjective,Actually in my opinion if it would only take the pictures with the same settings as it does the video it might actually be a good camera
positive,subjective,The video feature is a great improvement over my old camera
positive,subjective,You can allow the camera to take a few pictures before the group moves and therefore increase your odds of getting people looking at the camera and smiling
positive,subjective,"I do like the smile feature, it is much easier to use than a timer"
positive,subjective,Outdoor pictures tend to turn out better and landscape pictures are very nice as long as it's well before dusk
negative,subjective,"I can live with the red problem, but missing every picture at an outing with the kids is not an option"
negative,objective,"I guess if you could freeze time, adjust the camera to the new settings, then take the picture you might have a chance of overcoming the short falls of this camera"
negative,subjective,"I have tried to fix the red but the other colors, which were fine, get dull and washed out"
negative,subjective,"The second complaint is the colors, especially red is all messed up"
negative,subjective,"I can barely get a picture of my kid sliding down the slide, running, or swinging; it's just one blur of colors"
negative,subjective,My number one complaint is that it is horrible at taking action shots
negative,subjective,"I actually took both cameras to compare later, and yes the 7yr old camera produced much better pictures"
positive,subjective,I had to pull out my old camera to go trick-or-treating to ensure I actually got some good pictures
positive,subjective,This was not the case at all
negative,subjective,"Im very disappointed because I read extensive reviews and did my research before getting the Sony Cybershot and had anticipated receiving a great camera that was lighter in weight than the Fuji Finepix and a sure way to take great pics of my family/friends, my dog and vacation experiences"
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately, I used this camera to take pictures of my evening wedding and barely got any decent pictures as it doesn't seem to do well in low-light, even though there is a specific setting for it"
negative,subjective,"I'm not sure if the camera I have is defected or what, but compared to my previous Fuji Finepix camera, this one overall is just very frustrating"
negative,objective,"), or your hand shakes even a little bit, the pictures all come out blurry and fuzzy"
negative,subjective,No matter what setting I have selected for a picture if the object moves even slightly (I'm talking about not even breathing for the picture
positive ,objective,"I am a moderate camera user and tend to take all the pics for events and group outings for everyone to go and grab off my facebook page, so it's important that I have an easy, no fuss camera that can smoothly handle and deal with moving objects"
negative,subjective,"Once this camera is out of the warranty period, if it breaks again, it's going in the trash and I'll be searching for a new camera"
positive,subjective,"When it works, it's very very good"
negative,subjective,"By the looks of the other reviews, I probably just got a lemon"
negative,objective,The lens stays put
negative,objective,I've removed the battery numerous times
negative,objective,tells me to turn off and back on
negative,objective,It just refuses to open
negative,objective,"In the short 7 months that I have owned it, it has gone to the Sony repair center TWICE"
positive,subjective,It took come great pictures and the zoom was awesome
positive,subjective,"I recently purchased a Panasonic DMC-ZS6 for about the same price, and have found it to be a superior camera in almost every way"
negative,objective,"But due to the user-unfriendliness and poor picture quality, I can't recommend this camera"
negative,subjective,"I even tried sticking several layers of opaque tape over the flash to see if that would work, but as expected, the results were inconsistent"
negative,subjective,"I tried making changes in the user-accesable menus, but never could compensate for the over-exposure issue"
negative,subjective,Worst of all is that the picture quality just isn't very good
negative,subjective,"My Fujifilm and Canon cameras allowed the user to change many of the menu functions, why doesn't Sony"
negative,subjective,"This may not be a problem for most users, but I find it very irritating"
negative,objective,"Also, you can't access some of the features that would be nice to change, such as the length of time the picture is displayed after taking it, or similar functions"
negative,subjective,"As a matter of fact, I have missed a few good shots because of this"
negative,subjective,"Half of the time I end up looking at the top of the camera to see if my finger is positioned correctly, which is very frustrating if you are trying to snap off a picture quickly"
negative,subjective,"I have normal-sized hands and fingers, but have a terrible time telling if my index finger is on the shutter or not"
negative,subjective,"I have found it to be difficult to use, simply because the controls are tiny"
negative,objective,This stopped working after 6 months
negative,objective,"Sony says that it's impositivesible for things to get under the lens, but dust got under mine &amp; now ruins all of my shots of the sky with dark spots from the dust"
negative,subjective,"00 to fix it Wow that's a ton considering what i paid for it, Why not just buy a new camera which is what im looking to do now"
negative,subjective,Now im stuck with a non working camera for a third time and they told me they wanted 170
negative,objective,not all i have is blurry kid pics
positive,subjective,In the beginning it worked pretty good i was happy
negative,objective,"What mine camera does is the anti-shake light comes on no matter if I am holding it or it is sitting on a counter, well any slight movement pics turn out fuzzy"
negative,subjective,"Is always seems to have the same problem, When i first got it the pics were great for at least a few days"
negative,subjective,Well the only problem is that is really hard to do if it is either not working properly or it is in service
positive ,objective,I purchased this camera thinking it would be great to get pictures of my daughter as she grows
negative,objective,"This was past the warranty period, so I was stuck with a defective camera"
negative,objective,"That meant that every time we took a picture, we had to manually open the cover, or else the picture would be cropped"
negative,objective,"The reason for the 2 stars is that approximately 6 months after we bought the camera, the lens cover stopped opening fully"
negative,subjective,"Outdoors, the camera is passable, however the sharpness can be hit or miss"
negative,objective,"When taking pictures inside the house or at parties, the colors as well as focus is off"
negative,objective,The main drawback with this camera is indoor or low light photography
positive,subjective,"Initially, the pictures came out good, however I did notice a change from the old Sony"
positive,subjective,The camera is nicely built with easy to use controls
negative,subjective,Sometimes I can't get the shutter pushed down (maybe it's trying to do some auto adjustments or maybe too soon after previous shot
negative,objective,I have tried numerous settings and nothing seems to have helped
negative,subjective,After 2 years of having this camera I have quite a large collection of blurry pictures of my kids just after they did something interesting
negative,subjective,and his pics were AMAZING compared to mine
negative,objective,I have searched online and reset to factory defaults/professional cleanings etc
negative,subjective,I can look back and count maybe a 100 pics in thousands that are worth keeping if it wasn't for my priceless growing kids faces
negative,subjective,"It focuses on odd things like waste paper baskets instead of peoples faces, it takes FOREVER to process even with an upgraded card"
negative,subjective,"With this Sony most of my pics are blurry, have a reddish tint to them, double vision look, macro pops on during scenery pics, pics with flash are washed out, or it doesn't use flash when it needs it"
positive,objective,Just to compare my old camera had just came back from St Lucia with over 500 quick snap pics that took your breath away even fast shots on a helicopter
positive,subjective,However I know good pics when I see them and I haven't seen any for a long time now
negative,objective,The memory slot is for Sony memory card and is NOT SD like every other camera in the world
negative,objective,Problem is happening with multiple memory sticks
negative,objective,"&#34; It's also reporting, &#34;Error formatting memory stick,&#34; even though the memory stick has already been formatted"
negative,objective,Camera is reporting that &#34;This 'memory stick' may not record or play
negative,subjective,How could Sony make a camera with a screen that is useless if used outside
negative,subjective,"Be aware, if using the camera outside in sunlight the screen is almost impossible to see"
positive,subjective,This may be good for out-door camera where bright light is required for better quality of picture
negative,subjective,Low light picture quality is NOT satisfied
negative,objective,Below average photos the images look soft dull and to a degree under developed
negative,objective,"Just recently I forgot was in my pocket when I jumped in a pool, and now it is ruined"
negative,subjective,I will be replacing my junked Sony with the Canon PowerShot D30 Waterproof Digital Camera
negative,objective,The repair was going to be $207 so they offered me a replacement for $200 - even though a new camera is $249
negative,objective,"A corner of the display came loose, so I sent the camera to Sony's Laredo repair facility"
negative,objective,The display also scratched VERY easily and that soon became a problem
negative,subjective,The display however is terrible as you can't see anything in daylight so changing settings is next to impossible
positive,subjective,Takes great pics
negative,objective,"So if you have kids, pets or just don't want to wait forever for the camera to respond you should consider another camera"
negative,objective,2 MP sensor on DSC-TX30 Sony forgot to update their image processor and if they did it's not powerful enough
positive,objective,All this cards are very fast and most of them are class 10 and none of them made a difference with this particular camera
negative,objective,First they tried to convince me to buy a Sony micro SD card claiming that Sony cards are the only ones they recommend to use with their cameras
negative,subjective,Sony's customer service is beyond ridiculous
negative,subjective,We missed so many great shots of our kids because of this camera's incredible sluggishness
negative,subjective,Things get worse using a flash (up to  6-7 sec between the shots)
negative,objective,It takes up to 4 sec in a good light condition to process a picture and you can't take another one until it's done processing
negative,subjective,The DSC-TX5 did a great job until recently when water got into it and it died( I guess waterproofing the camera is not one of the Sony's strengths)
negative,subjective,very slow in taking photos (even though using ultra fast micro SD card)
negative,subjective,very bad photos in dark (low light) situations
positive,subjective,nice photos in the daylight
positive,subjective,good underwater
negative,objective,Eventually I was offered to buy a new one for a reduced price of $100
negative,objective,"I tried and tried to talk with Sony, to figure out what may have caused he corrosion, but I got nowhere"
negative,objective,"It was submerged one time, and barely used"
negative,objective,"It was within the warranty, but Sony would not honor it because &#34;corrosion&#34; had occurred"
negative,subjective,"The camera is still in warranty, but I don't have high hopes for Sony customer service"
negative,objective,"Same error again, and nothing seems to fix it"
positive,objective,When I got back from the trip I downloaded the photos from the camera leaving the card in place now it worked
positive,subjective,Eventually by fiddling it seemd to work OK
negative,objective,The new carmera worked once then gave the C:13:01 error
positive,objective,I needed the camera for a trip so I returned the camera and bought another (I got the message from customer service after I got back from the trip)
negative,objective,I logged a ticket with Sony Customer service
negative,subjective,I thought it was the memory so I bought another - both worked on my PC
negative,objective,"I ordered one, then purchased memory but got the dreaded &#34;C:13:01&#34; error / &#34;Reinsert the memory card&#34; error"
negative,objective,"hard to see screen when in sun, cant see what you are trying to photo will be sending back"
negative,objective,Useless in bright sunlighht
negative,objective,A little cropping produce generic pictures
negative,objective,Found a hazy spot on close ups created by a blemish on lens protective coating
negative,objective,"I have no evaluation of image quality, because I was too frustrated with all the other functions"
negative,objective,It constantly would give me the &#34;unable to connect to shooting device&#34; error on two separate iPhones
negative,objective,"But the deal breaker was the awful wifi, which was one of the main reasons that I purchased this camera"
negative,objective,I never did figure out how to control the autofocus properly either
negative,subjective,The hand grip is about half as thick on this model and it just doesn't feel secure in the hand
negative,objective,I'm also noticing that the menu navigation is getting a mind of its own- the highlight moves to another selection without being touched
negative,objective,The most common settings I use are toward the bottom of the menu- that may not be true for everyone
negative,subjective,&#8226;The menu navigation is awkward
negative,objective,"Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't"
negative,subjective,I would take a set of pictures and then get a message that it couldn't save them and it would prompt me to recover them
negative,objective,&#8226;I have had periodic issues with it not saving a sequence of photos
negative,subjective,All of my photos are taken inside but even bright light from a skylight can be too much
negative,subjective,&#8226;The display is very hard to see in bright light conditions
negative,subjective,"If I don't, I have to run through all of the folders listed on the card to get to the one I need"
negative,objective,I have to manually delete the folder with the card in the camera
negative,objective,&#8226;Erasing a folder from the memory card while it's in my memory card reader does NOT erase it from the card so it still shows up in the list of folders but is read only
negative,objective,"After less than 9 months, it's gotten to the point that I have to pry the flash up with my thumbnail while pressing the button to get it to pop up"
negative,subjective,&#8226;The pop up flash is also VERY flimsy and having an automatic flash doesn't do you any good if you have to manually make the flash pop up
negative,objective,I used to be able to use my fingertip and now I have to use a fingernail
negative,subjective,&#8226;The battery door is flimsy and I have to open it often to take the memory card out to get the photos off of it (it's much quicker than using the software)
positive,subjective,I've had this camera since January and the pictures are fine
positive,subjective,Good thing about it is that it fits in your back pocket
negative,objective,"Granted, I use my camera quite a lot and take tens of thousands of photos a year, but the flash is obviously not up to the standards of the rest of the unit"
negative,objective,Discount the time it was at Sony being repaired (twice) and that's three flashes failed in less than one year of use
negative,objective,"I purchased this camera 1 year and 20 days ago, so it is now twenty days out of warranty and just burned out its third flash"
negative,subjective,it just didn't work for me
negative,objective,"I found that for most of the shooting I did, this camera just didn't cut it"
negative,objective,**** UPDATE 12/13/14:  I ultimately gave up on this camera and returned it
positive,subjective,"Fortunately, I bought it from Amazon so that process is painless"
positive,subjective,Video quality is pretty good
negative,objective,"But, once you're back inside, it's too late to fix"
negative,objective,I wish I would have seen that when I shot them
positive,objective,"So, on my trip, I'd shoot pictures during the day, then review them at the hotel at night"
negative,subjective,"Unfortunately, when you're outdoors, you can't judge the quality because the screen is so washed out"
positive,subjective,"Some pix are pretty good, many are mediocre"
positive ,objective,How's the picture quality
negative,objective,"The PlayMemories software for importing pix is also kludgy, but I knew that from my previous Sony experience"
negative,objective,"In fact, I had to remove/reinsert the battery a few times before I could retract the zoom"
negative,objective,", the camera froze up while shooting and I had to remove the battery to force a reboot so the zoom would retract"
negative,objective,It renders the zoom worthless as well:  you can't zoom in on something you can't see
negative,objective,This also renders most of the features worthless since you can't see the on-screen settings
negative,subjective,"As others have pointed out, the screen is essentially unusable outdoors, making it hard to frame shots"
positive,objective,The long zoom reach is attractive for a vacation camera
positive,subjective,"I love the feature set of this camera, which closely mirrors the A-57"
positive,objective,I bought the HX50V so I could travel light on a short trip we were taking to Hawaii where I didn't want to lug a DSLR around
negative,subjective,"I have the impression that Sony is riding on their reputation, the camera I had originally replaced 2 years ago had put in over 5 years of service, even going on several bakpacking trips (including Grand Canyon)"
negative,objective,For my next camera I'll stick with stationary flash camera and switch to another reputable brand
negative,objective,"I'm a bit miffed at Sony as this is the second camera in under 2 years with major problems, and since my original warranty is up, they won't fix it for free"
negative,subjective,"I think the wire to the pop-up flash broke, as there was a spark from the black of the flash and a popping noise"
negative,subjective,"While I love all the features, after less than a year of use the flash gave out"
negative,subjective,everything looked blurry no matter what
negative,objective,Not sure how it is 20 MP
negative,subjective,I found that it took terrible pictures compared to any other camera I have had
negative,subjective,product looks old and the pictures i took are not clear and good
negative,objective,wont power off 6 months after purchase
negative,subjective,Pictures were blurry and simply not up to par
negative,subjective,It sounded like I was underwater
negative,subjective,"However, when using the video function -- the camera was just awful"
negative,subjective,I expected a better quality of the photos :/
negative,objective,"In other words, you have to leave the camera on the floor while charging or on a chair because a one foot cord is incapable of reaching a table of average height"
negative,objective,"Finally, the charger for this camera is approximately one foot in length AT MOST"
negative,objective,"I couldn't even distinguish my mother from my cousin, even though my mom was wearing a bright purple dress"
negative,objective,"I used automatic, night mode, and party mode, and every single shot came out dark"
negative,objective,"I kid you not, we did not get ONE useable photo out of 101 shots"
negative,objective,"Upon closer examination of the pictures she took, I noticed everyone's skin came out looking nearly snow white, which I can't begin to understand because my entire family is of a mixed African descent"
negative,objective,My mom said she could make due with the delay
negative,objective,"Every single photo, someone was either blinking or just looked exhausted from smiling for too long"
negative,objective,I soon realized she was taking pictures 6 or 7 times over each time because there is a HUGE delay between the time the button is pressed and the photo is taken
negative,subjective,"The flash feature is also very delayed, which makes picture taking slow"
negative,subjective,"Although this item had several strong complimentary reviews, I found the photo lense to be fuzzy when viewing compared to iPhone or Samsung phone cameras"
positive,subjective,Simple not worth its price
negative,subjective,Pictures are somehow always blurry
positive,subjective,Video is better then my go pro
positive ,objective,Anyone who had done something similar understands where I am coming from: portability of the camera; good image quality; and &#34;ease of use&#34;
positive,subjective,Great photos
negative,objective,"The quality of cell phone photography is lacking - and, it takes too long to fiddle with the phone get decent shots"
positive,objective,I use the Cybershot in the rain and make underwater videos when releasing fish
positive,objective,I keep the camera inside my parka tucked into the shirt pocket
negative,objective,"But, it is too bulky to haul around all the time"
positive,subjective,"I have a Nikon DSLR, which takes great photos"
positive,objective,Spend $20 on a 32 GB Sony chip and you will have storage for thousands of 6MB+ photos and many  250 MB video clips in HD lasting around 2 minutes each
positive,objective,The camera is light and stores well for in a shirt pocket
positive,subjective,You can change features quickly
positive,objective,The general menu pops up without delay
positive,subjective,Reviewing images is a lot of fun - no delay - quick zoom
negative,subjective,My only complaint with the TX10 is that the electronics are very slow
positive,subjective,Both work great and have been used much
positive,subjective,Love the press button video feature
positive,objective,"If left handed, you might cover the lens with your finger"
positive,subjective,Nice camera and easy to use if you're right handed - even held and clicked in 1 hand
positive,objective,Best 200 bucks i spent on an electronic device all year
positive,subjective,takes great pictures in bright and low lights and is great for the water
positive,subjective,It's easy to use (idiotproof) and you can review the pics like you do an iphone w/a simple finger swipe
positive,subjective,"But, great camera and it has replaced my old underwater camera and JVC HD video cam"
positive,objective,I was even able to take panarama pictures under water
positive,subjective,People that had Go pro's was very impressed with the underwater videos
positive,subjective,"It takes great pictures and video, both on dry land and in the water"
positive ,objective,Also takes beautiful clear underwater photos and video
positive,subjective,"I bought it for SCUBA diving, but I have taken it camping and it takes amazing photos and video"
positive,subjective,The burst mode is fantastic when capturing dives into the pool
positive,subjective,Takes great video too
positive ,objective,"Pictures are so clear, camera is sleek always carry in my bag light weight"
positive,objective,"Save your phone battery for phone calls/email/facebook and use this standalone camera, you won't regret it"
positive,objective,"I am a fan of the standalone digital camera for important vacations (think europe, study abroad and other trips where you want to take A LOT of pictures)"
positive,subjective,"This line is fantastic, I own a Sony T3 DLSR and I frequently use this instead"
positive,subjective,"This camera is also great for low light shooting (it has a red no flash light which turns on in low light, creating some of the best low light shots I have been able to take)"
positive ,objective,"This camera is water resistant (&#34;waterproof&#34; but you have to be very careful, I destroyed my 2nd Cybershot when I was careless snorkeling)"
positive ,objective,There are cheaper Sony Cybershots available but this one has surprising quality and durability for a small camera
negative,subjective,")  Please be aware, all cybershots are not created equal"
positive,objective,"However, the C2 button can be repurposed for that function via the menus, and although it doesn't work 100% as before, it does the job"
positive,objective,"This is a much-needed upgrade, and will make this function usable for me now"
positive,objective,"Speed priority is no longer there, I presume because of the much faster image processor and autofocus renders it unnecessary"
positive,objective,Continuous Shooting drive mode now offers three modes:  lo/mid/hi
positive,subjective,"+ Better low-light performance:  Shooting back-to-back with the NEX-6, the A6000 yields much cleaner JPG output at a given ISO"
positive,objective,"I was able to get the camera set to my liking in a fraction of the time that it would have taken with the NEX-6, even today after using it for over a year and nearly 10,000 shots"
positive,objective,"In addition, it offers multi-frame NR as an additional option when selecting auto-ISO (though this option is not available when shooting in RAW/JPG mode)"
positive,objective,The A6000 offers 1/3-stop increments:  100/125/160/200/etc
positive,objective,+ More ISO Choices:  The NEX-6 ISO settings were in 1-stop increments - 100/200/400/800/etc
positive,subjective,Focus seems very accurate as well
positive,objective,"Even in low light situations that would leave the leave the NEX hopelessly hunting for focus, it can lock on"
positive,subjective,DSLR fast
positive,subjective,"First off, the biggest improvement by far is the autofocus"
negative,objective,"The battery life is pretty short, but about what I'd expect for a camera with no optical viewfinder"
negative,objective,"Normally I conserve power by using the viewfinder, but it is actually rated for fewer shots than using the screen in the manual"
negative,objective,"Minor cons: Not a con, but definitely counter-intuitive; the viewfinder takes more power than the screen"
positive,objective,"Optional zebra stripes for overexposure, and focus peaking"
positive,subjective,Very clear digital viewfinder looks almost as good as the screen
positive,subjective,Good low-light handling
positive,subjective,Sound is clear and in stereo
positive,objective,"Great video quality, and up to 60fps video in 1080p for quality slow-motion shots"
positive,objective,"Full size 24mp APSC sensor, as big as a full size SLR"
positive,subjective,"Very impressive auto focus that never seems to be searching or fishing around for a focus point, it just jumps to it"
positive,objective,"Pros: 11fps shooting for up to 6 seconds before the buffer slows down, or half that with raw+jpeg"
positive,subjective,Highly recommended as an upgrade from NEX-6
positive,objective,"Compared to the NEX-6, from which I just upgraded, the a6000 has (1) much faster, more accurate AF (works as advertised"
positive ,objective,"I mean really, 11fps with autofocus between shots, new 24mp Sony sensor, upgraded hybrid auto-focus, a very attractive body only price"
negative,subjective,Same battery as Sony NEX line so easily available
negative,objective,"when in video mode, half press would cause refocus)"
negative,subjective,- Wish there was better control over focus in videos (e
negative,objective,"Toggling airplane mode helps, but no way to create a custom button action to do this"
negative,objective,- Shutter is louder than you'd expect for a mirrorless
negative,objective,which turns off the LCD for a second
negative,objective,Lots of things trick it into thinking you are using the eyepiece
positive,objective,- 11fps burst mode with auto-focus between shots is cool
positive,objective,- Good ISO range with auto-ISO having bounds (e
positive,subjective,3 MP of details in a tiny camera that you can take everywhere it's so small
positive,subjective,A great upgrade to the nex now alpha line
positive ,objective,"It is an amazing camera, as impressive as it gets, there is nothing in it's price range that can touch it"
positive,objective,"Overall, the quality of pics with the zeiss 16-70 lens attached is stunning"
negative,subjective,Hopefully they will issue a firmware update soon to improve this
negative,subjective,"However, it takes longer to start than my year old entry level f3"
negative,subjective,You would think that as fast as this camera is it would start up quickly
negative,subjective,I don't know why it takes so long to start up
negative,subjective,The startup is too slow
positive,subjective,It is still very useable though
negative,objective,"If it can't find focus, it tries once and then quits"
negative,objective,"If it can find a focus point, it does so fairly quickly with less hunting than the f3 did"
negative,subjective,The focus in low light is still slow
positive,objective,The f3 used to give me fits trying to get just the right spot in focus
positive,subjective,"Using the small point, the focus is much more consistently correct"
positive,subjective,I love the fact that this camera has the ability to change the size of the focus point in spot focus
positive,subjective,The focusing is dramatically faster and more accurate
positive,objective,I paired this new body with the zeiss 16-70 lens
negative,subjective,I wished it had a few more manual controls or custom buttons
negative,subjective,It was too slow and often slightly off
positive,subjective,The image quality was great
positive,objective,Initial reports made me hold off on buying one because there were just too many tradeoffs from a conventional dslr
positive ,objective,"The on-to-shoot time is a little slower than your average dSLR, but the autofocus is much faster and works fantastically"
positive,objective,I think it is pocketable in cargo shorts with a pancake lens
positive,subjective,"Compared to my Nikon, the size is amazing too"
positive,subjective,"First, the picture quality is outstanding with the stock lens"
negative,objective,Remove or cover it to prevent the battery door from sticking
negative,objective,"Unfortunately, they put a sticker on the battery, which causes the battery door to stick"
positive,objective,Sony is using a new slightly smaller and lighter battery in this camera
positive,subjective,The camera is made of hard plastic but it feels very solid
negative,subjective,"You probably will want to buy a separate charger, charging via USB port is very inconvenient"
negative,subjective,"The kit lens is poor, needs to be closed a couple stops to be useful, in my view the additional $150 for it is mostly wasted"
negative,objective,"Either get an Adobe Lightroom, or the free Adobe DNG converter if you have some other software"
negative,subjective,Supplied software is junk
negative,objective,"The sensor is absolutely great, but the jpeg engine is not, the noise reduction at high ISOs is terrible, turn it to OFF (though it's never off)"
positive,subjective,"God, I am so happy with the Sony a6000: photos quality is excellent, and what is great all of them are good to keep"
positive,subjective,And the colors and detail are stunning
positive,objective,I had to invest in several e-mount lenses from Sony and they also have top notch quality
positive,objective,The thing is I wanted a lighter camera but with equal or better specifications than my T4i
positive,subjective,"All in all, this camera has exceeded my expectations and is a joy to shoot with"
negative,subjective,But it wasn't enough to dock it a full point as it is something I am hopeful Sony can fix with firmware changes and is something I can live with if they don't
positive,objective,I ordered two non-Sony brand extra batteries and a wall charger bundled for about $25 and they work well and the charger also charges the real Sony battery
positive,objective,There are some non-Sony brand chargers/batteries on amazon you can get inexpensively
negative,objective,"Do yourself a favor and order separately, a wall charger and extra batteries for this camera"
negative,objective,- The camera doesn't come with a body cap
negative,objective,"So if you do a lot of HDR photography for example, this is something you will want to consider"
negative,subjective,This is a serious flaw that Sony needs to address and hopefully will with a firmware upgrade
positive,subjective,I love how fast the focus is and the amazing fps
positive,objective,The camera packs a lot of features to it
positive,subjective,The quality of images is outstanding with the large sensor and high mega pixel count
positive ,objective,"I recently set out to find a good camera capable of DSLR quality images but in a compact, lightweight, and easy to carry around design"
positive,subjective,"Put him SEL 35F18, quality very satisfied"
positive,subjective,Preservation and transmission of images very quickly
positive,objective,Well integrated into the home network Wireless
positive,objective,Mounted laying on the network
positive,objective,SEL series lenses provide chic hybrid autofocus
positive,subjective,Price decent home camera
positive ,objective,When the A6000 is coupled with some good glass it produces an outstanding image and is very fast too
negative,subjective,I tried a variety of settings and options with the A6000 but the NEX consistently produced the better image at sunset
negative,objective,The A6000 just did not catch the true colors and the NEX 7 did
positive,objective,"I found only one area where the NEX 7 consistently out performed the A6000, colorful sunsets"
positive,subjective,The A6000 has an easier to use menu system which is also superior to the NEX 7
positive,subjective,The view finder on the A6000 was clear and sharp and I actually prefer it to the NEX 7 view finder
positive,objective,The NEX 7 found itself relegated to a secondary roll with one of my Zeiss lenses
positive,subjective,Good clean shots were so much easier/faster than the NEX 7
positive,subjective,"Its ability to focus is fast, I mean really fast"
positive,subjective,I quickly found that the Sony 70-200 lens on the A6000 was just brilliant
positive,subjective,I have taken 600 shots and really all of them are best I have ever seen from any other camera
positive,objective,I won't have to do to much touching up in photoshop with these pictures
positive,objective,"You can also set it up so it auto uploads each photo you take to flickr, or Sony's own photo sharing site as well"
positive,subjective,"The wireless photo transfer works great with my Android HTC One M8, as well as my wife's iPhone 5"
negative,objective,"My only complaint is the clunky app interface, but you're rarely going to download apps, so it's not much of an issue"
positive,subjective,"The photo quality with the included lens is amazing, video quality, even in low light situations is equally amazing, since it takes full 1080p video, in either AVCHD or lower bitrate MP4 format"
positive,objective,"Sony made some major changes with this, using a hybrid focusing system, which makes this the fastest focusing camera currently out on the market"
negative,objective,"I've never dealt with a Mirror-less SLR camera like this before, but have heard the auto focus can be slow on most"
positive,subjective,So I figured i'd give it a try since amazon has such an amazing return policy
negative,objective,"But, make sure to buy extra batteries"
positive,subjective,I would recommend it over an entry-level DSLR
positive,objective,Noise and Heat: 9/10
negative,subjective,I'd recommend buying at least 2 extra batteries and maybe an external charger
negative,objective,by micro USB into the camera
negative,objective,- Charging from 0% to 100% takes about 2-3 hours and no external charger is included; charging is done
negative,objective,- Going through the menu and changing options drains the battery about 1% a minute as well
negative,objective,"but, the battery still drained quickly"
negative,objective,- You can actually watch the battery decrease by 1% every minute while the camera is turned on
negative,objective,- This is the Achilles' heel of the camera as the battery drains frighteningly fast
negative,objective,Battery Life: 7/10
positive,objective,- Make sure to update the firmware (ver 02) for these lenses to get faster AF
positive,subjective,- The 55-210mm lens is also sharp throughout the focal range
positive,subjective,8 lens and the images are extremely sharp and background blur is very nice
positive,objective,- I'm using the 50mm f/1
positive,objective,- AF-S and AF-C are extremely fast compared to the Canon T4i
positive,subjective,Image Quality &amp; Performance: 9
positive ,objective,- No touchscreen; this would have made picking a focus point MUCH easier
negative,subjective,- Screen is hard to see in bright sunlight; use EVF instead
positive,objective,"- The EVF, although a downgrade from the NEX-6, is serviceable and great for using in bright conditions"
negative,subjective,"- Coming from Canon's interface, I had a hard time finding what I wanted in the menus"
negative,objective,User Interface and Features: 7/10
positive,objective,Build Quality: 9/10
positive,objective,"At $600-650 for the body only, the a6000 punches way above its price and weight"
positive,objective,8 MP gave me more detail and cropping options
positive,objective,Images from the a6000 were less noisy at the same ISO in my tests and the extra
negative,objective,I exchanged my original camera for a replacement after experiencing quick battery drain and found the second
positive,subjective,"Also, it would have been nice if the LCD was a touch screen"
positive,subjective,"Lastly, I love that the LCD screen folds out"
negative,objective,"Also, and this is picky, the hot-shoe does not come with a protective cover and is just expositiveed"
negative,subjective,Hoping that Sony comes out with a battery with a longer life
negative,objective,"The only cons to owning the a6000 is the battery life, which is just ok"
positive,subjective,You still get a really nice output of photos
positive,objective,"The pros are that you can use your A-Mount lenses on an E-Mount camera, like the a6000"
positive,objective,"To boot, if you own an A77 or other Sony Alpha DSLR SLT camera, you may want to consider in investing in the Sony A-Mount to E-Mount (LAEA4) Adapter"
positive,subjective,I love the output of these lens combinations with the a6000
positive,objective,"Additionally, I also purchased the 50mm 1"
positive,subjective,"It's also great in indoor low-light, action, landscape, portrait"
positive ,objective,"Very easy to use and most importantly, it takes very clear and crisp photos"
positive,objective,"So far, GREAT combination"
positive,objective,3 zoom lens separately
positive,objective,I decided to get the body only and purchased the Sony E-Mount 18-200mm f/3
positive,subjective,Menu is easy to navigate and loaded with features
positive,subjective,The video quality is a surprise - super clean &amp; crisp HD video
positive,subjective,The a6000 is extremely capable &amp; fun to use
positive,subjective,3 MPix Sensor does a good Job
positive,subjective,Very Light Camera
positive,subjective,Very high Image Quality
positive,objective,Its  Very Fast Auto Focus in the World helped me Shoot Fashion Shows Beauty Pageants
positive,subjective,"the only thing is that the camera body is small and the lenses available are large and quite nice appealing, i just close on eye on that issue"
positive,subjective,"picture quality is very good but i think it is not perfect, but good deal for the money"
positive,subjective,"i love the in camera HDR results, and it quite fast indeed"
positive,subjective,the focus is fast and it took impressive video clips with no noticeable out of focus at all
positive,subjective,"very good camera, it took me a while to master most of the functionality and still a lot to know"
positive,subjective,Love that you can &#34;bump&#34; the photos to your smart phone and post on Facebook or email/text to a friend
positive,objective,"Conveniently, the A6000, A7R and RX10 all use the same Sony NP-FW50 battery"
positive,objective,5x magnification with any FE (full sensor E-mount) lens compared to the full-sized sensor A7R
positive,objective,"Since the A6000 sensor is APS-C, you get a 1"
positive,subjective,"I also use this body with Sony's FE-mount f4 OSS 70-200mm, which is incredibly light in weight and shockingly sharp"
positive,objective,Using the A6000 with Sony's FE-mount f4 24-70mm Zeiss lens results in super-sharp images with unsurpassed color accuracy
negative,objective,"I bought the body only, since the kit lens (while inexpensive and convenient) just isn't up to the high quality of the sensor"
positive,objective,"The focus is so much faster than the NEX-7 (or the A7R, for that matter)"
positive,objective,This saves an infinite amount of post-processing time
positive,objective,"Though I use my cameras primarily for professional purposes, the precision of Sony's electronic eyepiece viewfinders has allowed me to shoot in JPG (not RAW) mode because I can make nearly all adjustments BEFORE pressing the shutter"
positive,objective,The quality of the photo seems to be limited only by the quality of the lens
positive,objective,"With this camera, you don't have to wait until the buffer is empty before taking the next photo"
positive,subjective,The faster memory card means that photos go from the buffer onto the memory card faster
positive,objective,5 seconds before it slowed down
positive,objective,"In JPEG mode, I was able to shoot 50 shots in about 4"
positive,objective,It will shot at least twice as many shots than the NEX-6 before slowing down
positive,objective,"Because it will shoot 11 shots per minute, I recommend a 90 MB/sec or faster memory card"
positive,objective,This camera has vastly improved its ability to focus quickly
positive,subjective,"With my Tamron 18-200, it works exceptionally well"
positive,objective,"Vibration reduction, or optical steady shot (OSS) is built into the lens"
positive,objective,"The upgrade from 16 to 24 MP is appreciated, especially when cropping the shots"
positive,subjective,I recommend ebooks by Gary Friedman to sort out this information and make it the camera personalized to meet your needs
positive,objective,This means that you can customize the button/knob/icon settings to suit your needs
positive,objective,The A6000 has taken a lot of ideas from the A7 and A7R and applied them to this camera
positive,objective,The A6000 is improved in almost every way over the NEX-6
positive,subjective,The 3 memory recall slots save me sooo much time going from landscape to portrait to night tripod shooting
positive ,objective,"Crazy fast autofocus, great low light ability, love the EVF and tilt able LCD screen"
negative,subjective,"Only thing I really lost in the switch was battery life, I honestly see no other downside"
positive,subjective,A6000 with the sel35f18 is so small and light I'm amazed and carry it with me twice as often which is what I wanted
positive,subjective,Image quality is about the same as my d5200 but what I gained was something like 150 more focus points covering almost the entire frame which is amazing
negative,objective,"The bulk and weight were preventing me from always keeping my camera on me, even with a single prime lens it was larger than I wanted"
negative,objective,Got tired of lugging around a bulky dslr setup with 3 or 4 lenses
negative,objective,"Well the only thing not good enough is the switching between LCD and EVF, it is inconvenient to set in the menu, and when set to auto, it is too sensitive, when I lift up the LCD against my belly so that I can catch my daughter's face from a lower angle, it will automatically switch to EVF, which is not what I want"
positive,objective,"8 and the high iso, this camera can see more than my eye in dark, or with 1/20000 s speed, it can catch any move"
positive,objective,"8, which is 5 stars too, with this F1"
positive,subjective,"Photo quality is great, can easily catch each of my daughter's hair and floating dust, the 18-50mm lens is good, I bought a 50mm F1"
positive,subjective,The focus system is amazing
negative,objective,"I ordered on Amazon, but they can't deliver on time, so I bought one from BestBuy at 799, picked up 40 minutes after ordering online"
positive,subjective,Finally it is a great camera for anyone who just can't hold a large DSLR but still want quality photos
positive,subjective,It is a great learning camera for those who are teaching themselves photography
positive,subjective,This is a great camera for moms on the go who want to take incredible pictures  and be able to blow them up without loss of quality
positive,subjective,I realize that most DSLR cameras can do this but the great thing about this camera is that you can fit it in your purse
positive,objective,I also photographed my grandson's kindergarten graduation program using a 55-210 lens and again lighting was not an issue
negative,objective,I can't use a flash but only natural light
negative,objective,There is no good red eye correction for dogs
positive,subjective,It takes great photos in low lighting
positive,objective,The EVF is an improvement over the NEX-6 despite the lower pixel count
positive,subjective,It is easy to make quick changes with the menu items
positive,subjective,The new menu system is a great improvement over the old NEX system
positive,subjective,The dual control dials on top are very well laid out and easy to use
positive,subjective,It acquires focus quickly and reliably
positive,objective,3 MP  is often not noticeable but it does make a difference when cropping and in clarity on telephoto shots
positive,subjective,I took the chance and have found it to be a significant improvement
positive,subjective,"The wifi and NFC are nice for quickly uploading pictures to a phone or tablet, I use a Nexus 10 and have had no problems with the Sony app for sharing pictures and remotely controlling the camera"
positive,subjective,"The out of camera jpg's correct for the lens distortion and look very nice, with rich colors and a large dynamic range"
positive,objective,"I would caution that the 16-50mm power zoom, while nice and light and compact is pretty soft in the corners and there is some distortion at the 16mm end of the focal range"
positive,subjective,"The EVF is worth mentioning too, because it is big and bright and while it isn't as clear as a OVF it is nice enough that many times I forget I am using an EVF"
positive,subjective,"The A6000 has incredible AF and locks on very quickly, it does hunt in lower light but no worse than my Canon so I was still very happy with the AF"
negative,subjective,I was concerned that any camera I compared to the image quality of the Canon would leave me disappointed
negative,subjective,I was looking for a camera to use more for travel and hiking where my full frame Canon camera and lenses are just too big and heavy to lug around
positive,subjective,"&#34;For the money, WOW"
positive,objective,"A joy to use, especially keeping up with active kids, sports, and pets, fun"
positive,objective,3 MP interchangeable lens camera with the supplied 16-50 mm lens
positive,subjective,"Well anyway, buy one and there is a high probability you will be pleased with this entry level mirrorless Sony DSLR 24"
positive,objective,There are 10 major selections on the thumb-wheel and of course many options under some of the selections
positive,subjective,I like the viewfinder plus the tilt screen
positive,subjective,I like the hotspot and WIFI capabilities of the camera
positive,objective,A picture tells all without a conscious
positive,subjective,Being an old guy I feel that this is ignominious at times to think that the camera can compose a scene better than I
positive,objective,In the &#34;Superior Auto&#34; mode this camera will sometime recompose &amp; save a secondary photo which is superior to the shot I had originally composed
positive,subjective,I am pleased with this camera which yields excellent photos
negative,subjective,"My rational is that I have spent, for me a considerable amount of money for a good camera and I don't want to be at the mercy of a dead battery to ruin a perfectly enjoyable day of photographing"
negative,objective,"Probable one extra battery would do, however I am a conservative minded person"
positive,subjective,They are not expensive and I recommend that you get the charger that plugs directly into the wall &amp; vehicle utility power jack and the battery mounts directly on the charger
negative,objective,I carry along two extra batteries just in case
negative,subjective,With the discharge rate a recharge might be necessary which one would not want to do in the field
positive,subjective,A single battery on a photo shoot might last long enough
negative,objective,Likely with it's digital processing capability the a6000 requires a substantial amount of current from the battery
positive,objective,"I have to admit that its tempting, however I will likely not purchase a telephoto lens for this camera at this time and continue using my Canon DSLR telephoto lens cameras for a while longer"
positive,subjective,I am also pleased that this camera has some pre-set defaults that will many times exceed my knowledge of establishing settings for the scene being photographed
positive,subjective,Overall I am  pleased with this camera and the far reaching capabilities available through settings/prefs
positive,subjective,This menu is finally much easier to follow and being able to find what you need in a jiffy
positive,subjective,Super fast focus and agile snapping
negative,objective,This camera is a little bigger but actually with the built in grip it feels just right on your hand
positive,subjective,I sold my Sony RX 100-2 just because i hated not having a viewfinder ( and the complicate menu was driving me crazy)
positive,objective,I have several 20x30 prints hanging in my house that are tack sharp - I would put my photos up against a DSLR any day
positive,subjective,The autofocus is amazingly fast and the 24 megapixels allow for so much detail even after cropping
positive,objective,"I owned the NEX-3, one of Sony's first mirrorless cameras and was so impressed with the technology that I moved up to the a6000"
positive ,objective,"Overall still pretty impressive, and much easier to operate than the NEX-6"
negative,subjective,"If anything, I wish they wouldn't have downgraded the EVF resolution (it is clearly visible) and the omission of a level gauge isn't great either"
positive,subjective,I recommend getting a fast prime though for improved sharpness
positive,subjective,"Very light in the hand, but in a positive way"
positive,subjective,"fantastic camera, excellent auto-focus speed"
positive,subjective,"this camera does more, smaller and the shots are amazing"
positive,subjective,Takes great pics - rapid fire mode is great for getting pics of the kids
negative,objective,"The lack of weight, AF and lens options put Canon and Nikon's entry level DSLRs to shame"
negative,subjective,I need to manually delete photos off camera
negative,subjective,Does NOT play well with Mac computers
negative,subjective,I wish Sony had more tutorial videos for a a6000 line
negative,subjective,Manual and menus are not user friendly
positive,objective,High learning curve coming from a point-n-shoot but that is me
positive,objective,Huge USP in my book
positive,objective,Photos go straight into my photo library not app library
positive,objective,"Wireless sends photos to my phone - Amazing feature, just download the app and ready to go"
positive,subjective,"Great auto everything feature for non-camera guy, hubby"
positive,objective,Try that with a traditional DSLR
positive,objective,I wear it messenger bag style and it does not bump against my hip
positive,objective,So much easier to hold and focus when weight is not literally holding you back
positive,subjective,LOVE the lack of weight
positive,objective,Works with all other 3rd party lenses with adapter
positive,objective,Plenty of lens options and other accessories
positive,objective,Pancake style lens
positive,objective,"Think AF, B&W;, white balance at the touch of one button"
positive,objective,8 customizable function buttons
positive,subjective,I love how the same cable that charges the battery also connects to the computer
positive,subjective,"Six hours to charge the battery seems excessive but ha, the battery life once charged is pretty good"
positive,subjective,"This is a great camera for what I want, a step up from a point and shoot but better quality than a iPhone 5"
positive ,subjective,"I only have a couple Sigma and Sony primes, and the pancake zoom for social/fun stuff, but wow, what a great camera"
positive,objective,"My entire body is always aching after hauling DSLRs around after a wedding, but I can, and did haul this camera around for an entire 4 day wedding weekend with my family and didn't even feel it"
positive,subjective,I believe this is a superb price point/value for what it is
negative,subjective,There are certainly more expensive
positive,subjective,"If you are just looking for a nice upgrade from a cell phone or old snap shot for example, I think there are other very nice, and cheaper models to chose from"
positive,objective,Many people don't understand sensor size and obsess with megapixels that they'll affectively never use/need
positive,objective,) you can get extremely high quality photos for the cost of the cheapest L pro zoom lens (70-200 f4)
positive,subjective,"Of course you can throw a prime on the DSLR, but I'm just saying, for the money (and small size"
positive,objective,I can tell you this a6000 with a prime lens beats out a Canon L zoom very noticeably on a calibrated monitor
positive ,objective,"I find the a6000 far easier to use, very capable and high quality as a video camera, and super high quality as a still camera"
positive,subjective,How Sony is able to provide a camera like this at the price of a high-end point and shoot is beyond me
positive,subjective,"If you're an old-timer like me, the IQ and vast array of options will make you seriously fall in love with photography again"
positive,subjective,"Besides, for the price, what you get with this camera is simply remarkable"
positive,objective,"For the vast majority of shooting there are more than enough quick access buttons and such on the camera, most of which are customizable"
positive,subjective,"Concerning the folks who think the camera needs a touch screen, I do not agree"
positive,objective,The pictures I get from this lens reminds me of those I took with my first SLR and 50mm lens
positive,subjective,I really like their 30mm f2
positive,subjective,"By the way, Sigma makes some great inexpensive primes for the e-mount system and you will not be disappointed with them"
positive,subjective,"And if you have old glass, get some inexpensive adapters and use it"
positive,objective,"Oh, and the video"
positive,subjective,"If you want to take some great photos, and have a load of fun doing it, I seriously doubt you would ever regret this purchase"
positive,subjective,I continue to learn and use its many features in my quest to make better photographs
positive,subjective,It is exciting to finally find a camera that has so fully engaged my love for photography again
positive,subjective,"If you have any legacy glass (which I have a lot of,) simply buy an adapter and start shooting"
positive,objective,"You can pull it out when you first get it and start shooting immediately (provided you purchase it with a lens - I bought the 16-50 and 55-200,) and the photos are great, even when enlarged far beyond the old standby 8""x10"" size"
positive,subjective,What you get for the price is simply amazing
positive,objective,"This camera will do far more than most people really need, and takes pictures that are far superior to even the best fixed lens camera (the exception being the RX1 perhaps"
positive,objective,) I've loved photography for nearly 50 years and the advances that have been made are truly astounding
positive,objective,I was able to take publication quality pics of NYC at night from the top of the Empire State Building
positive,subjective,I'd love to see what they could come up with for a nicer long zoom lens
positive,subjective,I shoot through the 18-200 Sony lens and it's exceptional
positive ,objective,Very light and small but huge picture quality
negative,objective,Some reviewers had commented that their Sony A6000 overheated at around the 8-10 min mark while recording video
positive,subjective,"Fits in your hand nice, well balanced"
positive,subjective,It's the fastest camera I have ever used
positive,objective,"I'm still getting to know everything about the A6000, but the simplicity with which it takes great pictures is second to none"
positive ,objective,Anyone can take pictures like these with this camera
positive ,subjective,If you don't know anything about photography just set it to Intelligent Auto and it will still take fantastic pictures
positive,subjective,This is a great light compact walkabout camera with excellent image quality
negative,objective,so when a problem occurs you need to stop everything and access the in-camera manual which answers
negative,objective,"An excellent camera, but complicated enough that a comprehensive manual is needed and not provided"
positive,subjective,"Also, 5 star for the price"
negative,objective,And touch screen will only slow down the capture speed
negative,subjective,It will be hard to make adjust without command dial
negative,subjective,"I checked the A5100 sample, still horribly yellow"
negative,subjective,The auto color is horribly yellow
positive,objective,Under daylight the raw quality is even a good compete with 5D3
positive,subjective,After  correction the picture looks as good as an A7 camera
positive,subjective,"Raw is really good, the yellowish tune can be easily corrected by Lightroom"
positive,subjective,"At first I was worried about the color lost, but then proved it can be corrected by simple set up"
positive,subjective,Interface and control as easy as a DSLR
positive,subjective,The focus is really fast
positive,subjective,The A77 is still superior in handling long lenses and its battery life with the battery grip is good for any day of shooting
positive,subjective,It will also be a better second body than my trusty little NEX3N
positive,subjective,"Not as sharp as the Sigma primes but as a travel lens with jacket pocket portability, it is hard to beat"
positive ,objective,Focusing speed seem about the same so I would guess that any improvements were minor refinements
positive,subjective,"So how much better does the younger sibling of the permanently extended, slightly angled corpse sitting on my desk perform"
positive,objective,"BlackRapid is still my favorite strap but I learned a valuable lesson involving strap length, clearance and the fragility of kit lenses"
positive,objective,The time-out that would have retracted the lens and kept it from wedging between my hip bone and the turnstile as I went through
positive,objective,Quicker than the time-out setting on my camera
positive,objective,"During a recent trip to Disneyland, I snapped a picture in the courtyard between the two parks upon arrival then proceeded immediately into the park"
positive,objective,The New 16-50 Power Zoom:
positive,objective,The Time Lapse intervalometer app was only $10 (cheaper than the wired Chinese knock-off controllers) and has me smiling for now
positive,objective,There are also Motion Shot and Star Trail apps that look like they have some potential
positive,objective,"In addition to all of the interval settings, it can be set to create a movie automatically at the end of the sequence"
positive ,objective,The Time Lapse app is really pretty cool
positive,objective,Some of the paid apps have the same functions as those already on the A6000 and seem to be available as upgrades for the web-enabled models that don't have the option built-in
negative,subjective,"In practical use, I seldom (if ever) need a remote in a way the wireless Sony RMTDSLR2 can't provide"
negative,objective,"While I prefer the performance, desktop integration, awesome camera and intuitive interface, it's a bit of a pain to be last on the dev list for things like camera controls and smart home stuff"
positive,objective,") Other than that, it is of marginal use at this time since I use a Windows phone"
positive,objective,Cause this one has APPS
positive,subjective,Why I Now Need WiFi on a Camera:
positive,subjective,The detail captured with a good lens and normal care in how you shoot is pretty amazing
positive,subjective,"1MP APS-C sensor, you're in for a bigger surprise"
positive,subjective,"Fortunately, setting a custom white balance is ridiculously easy and the results are spot-on"
positive,objective,the A6000's AWB with CFL or incandescent lighting is hit and miss but that is true for almost any camera these days with 1000 different temperatures available in residential lighting
positive,subjective,"At low ISO in good light, all three produce spectacular detail with excellent color"
positive,subjective,"The A6000 is at least one full stop better in low light and in my opinion, shoots acceptable (your mileage may vary) images up to ISO 12,800"
positive,objective,"The NEX-7 was a incremental step up from the A77 in my opinion, probably due to not having the mirror stealing some of the light"
positive,objective,"If you only shoot heavy action occasionally or limit yourself to short bursts to catch the peak moment, the burst speed and its ability to track focus performs far above entry-level DSLRs and most-mid-range models"
negative,objective,"Unlike the A77, it needs 15-20 seconds to clear after a long burst (up to 49 JPEG/22 RAW) which may be an issue if you shoot a lot of action"
positive,objective,The buffer is a lot larger than the NEX-7 and even larger than the A77
positive,objective,The A77 has to &#34;slow down&#34; to 8 fps to match that
positive ,objective,The A6000 is only 1 fps slower than the A77's 12 fps speed-priority mode and will maintain autofocus and metering for each frame
positive,subjective,I am used to really fast burst shooting from the A77 and wasn't disappointed
positive,subjective,"The autofocusing with the 16-50 PZ is pretty amazing and if it is any better with a lens like the 70-200 f/4 FE lens, it may lead to a lot of soul-searching before I spend any money on a new DSLR"
positive ,objective,It does hunt a bit in really low light but no worse than most and better than some DSLRs at and above its price range that I've played with
positive,subjective,The three-zone multi-point focus like on the A77 has become my favorite but I will be exploring more during the months leading up to our next trip
positive,subjective,Lightning fast with more focus area options than I care to write about
positive,objective,it's in focus
positive,objective,I shoot with the NEX cameras a lot more than the A77 these days and am always shocked when I pick up the DSLR and focus on something
positive,objective,The A6000 is noted for its blazing autofocus and rightly so
positive,objective,179 Point Hybrid Autofocus:
positive,objective,I have programmed it to control focus assist magnification and it has made using manual focus and fine adjustments much easier
positive,objective,a small plus for the new shoe
positive,objective,"Come to think of it, my Alien Bees radio flash commander will fit the new hotshoe without an adapter"
negative,objective,My only gripe is that Sony abandoned theexcellent Minolta hotshoe for the newer &#34;multi-interface&#34; shoe
positive,objective,The pop-up flash features the same articulated setup as its predecessors that allows for bouncing within it power limits
positive,subjective,"Very, very easy to access settings"
positive,subjective,The consensus seemed to be that it is a competent camera that performs well above its price range
negative,subjective,"Bang for the buck, you cannot get a better camera; the Sony Alpha a6000 is amazing"
positive,subjective,Unbeatable performance and value
positive,objective,The design is all business
positive,objective,"This is more classic Leica sized, and there's subtle nod to a retro aesthetic without going faux rangefinder"
negative,subjective,"The only thing you give up is the extreme small size of the NEX-5 body, and the magnesium material use in the NEX-5"
positive,objective,That's a huge upgrade from the NEX-5 and it fixes the biggest deficiencies of the NEX-5
positive,objective,Wifi connectivity
positive,subjective,Excellent video performance
positive,objective,Electronic viewfinder
positive,objective,Crazy-fast shooting even with RAW+JPG
positive,objective,Fast focus
positive,objective,For $600 you get: 24 megapixels of Sony APS-C sensor goodness
negative,objective,I ended up taking multiple shots myself and stitching them together on my PC
negative,subjective,"Last thing, the panoramic mode seems hard to use - compared to my A55 or compacts that implement it - it always complains about the motion being too fast or not smooth enough"
negative,objective,It could be even more perfect - I miss the lack of GPS and artificial horizon from my A55
positive,subjective,"Finally, build quality is impecable, it feels solid in your hands, with each button and dial having a precise and perfectly weighted feel"
positive,subjective,"The finder on the a6000 is very sharp with accurate colours and exposure and little lag, except in very dark conditions (especially compared to my Sony A55)"
negative,subjective,"It is a bit larger, however, and won't fit in the small leather fannypack I used for the NEX"
negative,objective,"The menu is a bit skimpy, but the in-camera help menu is just fine"
positive,subjective,My pictures have never been better especially in auto mode
positive,subjective,I love the way you can switch from the eye piece to the LCD screen seamlessly
positive,subjective,This is a wonderful camera from Sony and it takes gorgeous pictures
negative,objective,5 seconds); battery does not last that long
negative,objective,CONS:  Slow to start up (2
positive ,objective,"PROS:  Low weight, Viewfinder (I do not use the LCD), flexibility; changeable lens capability"
positive,subjective,Personally though I have it set at Aperture priority and I select the appropriate shutter speed
positive,subjective,"The camera gives all the control you want, or need"
positive,subjective,Photograph quality is excellent in outdoor lighting as well is under low light conditions
positive,objective,"I bought a 55-210 zoom lens also, though mostly I just use the 16-50mm lens"
positive ,objective,"Flexibility is on par with the DSLR cameras, though the availability of lenses is much less"
positive,objective,The a6000 with the zoom lens weighs in at 20 oz with a MegaGear neoprene case
negative,objective,"The DSLRs (Panasonic K10, and Nikon D600) were too much camera for me - too much to carry around, these cameras with a single lens weighed in over 4 pounds - not my idea of fun"
positive,objective,"I am a casual user who likes better photographs, not a professional or even a gifted amateur"
negative,objective,The only draw back is the lack of a touch screen and 180 tillable screen for selfies
positive,objective,The Intelligent Auto Mode is top notch and captures beautiful images every time
positive,objective,With 24 mp - you can crop easily to get the exact picture that you want
positive,subjective,"If you need speed and clear pictures, this is the camera for you"
positive,objective,Baseball - you can get 6 frames with the ball and batter in the pic
positive,subjective,The shots I have gotten are absolutely incredible
positive,objective,it takes wonderful soccer pictures and stops players in mid air
positive,objective,"If you have a internet connection, you do not have to connect by USB cord to your PC"
positive,objective,I discovered after using the USB cord to transfer photos to my PC that you can very easily transfer them wirelessly with the free software that Sony supplies
positive,objective,You can get free apps that makes your phone into a remote with viewing capabilities
positive,subjective,"If you want to see yourself during self portraits, use your tablet or smart phone"
negative,objective,Another critic didn't like the fact that the small screen didn't flip up to the front of the camera for selfies
positive,subjective,It sounds like its coming from a very expensive microphone
positive,objective,"But for the Amateur, it can become a simple point and shoot camera with using the proper settings"
positive,objective,You can grow into its capabilities at your own pace
positive,subjective,Amateur photographers would be overwhelmed over all the technology that went into the Alpha a6000
positive,objective,3 Megapixels and the images are phenomenal
negative,objective,the kit lens is garbage imo
negative,objective,"On Continuous auto focus, it sometimes misses but it's nothing to sneeze at"
negative,subjective,"The one complaint I have always had with Sony is their lack of software updates, they are notorious for releasing a whole new body and leaving their existing customer in the dark"
negative,objective,The only issue I really have with the body is the layout of the buttons
positive,objective,I can comfortably shoot at 3200 iso and still print 8x10
positive,objective,"The image quality is absolutely off the charts, for an aps-c sensor the low light quality is top notch"
positive,objective,I can carry the body and a few lenses with out killing my back
positive,subjective,"I upgraded from the Nex-3, which is a pretty good shooter"
positive,subjective,Great camera with a fast frame per second
positive,subjective,"I'm always taking photos backpacking, traveling and doing other out-door activities and the A6000 is the perfect camera for this"
positive,subjective,Resolution is very good and it was surprised to see the crisp detail of tiny objects in some pics
positive,subjective,I can carry this in my jacket pocket and I now have a camera with me most times for those unexpected shots
negative,subjective,my Nikon DSLR and all its heavy lenses
positive ,objective,"Great camera, works incredibly well, the only thing I find to be obscured is that you have to pay for &#34;apps&#34; to use certain functions"
positive,subjective,This camera simplifies the settings very easily
positive,subjective,Super intuitive camera design
positive,subjective,Sony now has a more robust selection of e-mount lens to choose from
positive,subjective,"Any other lens, however, eliminates this issue"
positive,subjective,"It feels rather odd and not intuitive, but it works"
positive,subjective,"Also, the power zoom is a slide switch on the side of the kit lens"
positive,subjective,"On the A6000, stabilization is in the lens, and another lens might offer better results"
negative,objective,"If there's one thing I think is below par, it's the image stabilization"
positive,subjective,"It's a shame, because the image quality of this camera is good enough to make films that look great"
negative,objective,There are no adjustments for sound and there are no ports for external mikes or headphones except by using the Sony hot shoe
negative,subjective,"My advice here is to remove the camera strap holders if you don't use a strap, because they'll rattle against the camera if you don't"
positive,objective,The internal mikes are on the front of the camera and provide excellent vocal presence for home videos
positive,objective,AGC is smooth and gradual without intruding on natural sounds
positive,subjective,Sound quality is rich and crisp with no undue AGC pumping action
positive,objective,It has the standard electrical contact for use with other brand flashes in addition to having the Sony proprietary contacts for use with Sony microphones or lights
positive,objective,An industry standard hot shoe tops the camera
positive,objective,Build quality is solid and tight with no squeaky plastic sounds when you grip the camera
positive,objective,The left mounted viewfinder makes for easy viewing without nose smudges on the LCD
positive,objective,"You might expect this on a full size 3000 dollar camera, but on a pocket camera under 500, it's almost unheard of"
positive,subjective,It's simply amazing how much manual control this camera allows
positive,objective,You can shoot spotlight illuminated actors on stage without blowing out the faces with overexposure
positive,subjective,You can shoot in very low light without dark backgrounds looking grainy
positive,objective,"Video shot with this camera is good enough to use commercially, assuming of course, your client doesn't see you using a pocket sized camera"
positive,objective,Add in the ability to manually control sharpness and color saturation and you have one heck of a video camera
positive,objective,"In addition, you can fine tune each of those settings to precisely match your lighting, then take it up or down manually to warm up or cool down the image as you see fit"
positive,objective,"This allows just enough variable light control for the conditions you're shooting in, while not going to the extremes of overexposure or too much grain"
positive,objective,"You can program the ISO to be variable only between two preset levels, say from ISO 125 to ISO 4000, or any other settings you choose"
positive,subjective,But suppose you don't want the gain to rise to the point where the image gets grainy
positive,objective,"In ISO only auto mode, you can control your aperture and shutter speed while allowing the ISO to adjust the gain automatically for changing light conditions"
positive,subjective,This becomes really important for video
positive,subjective,"What's nice is you can select a single manual function while leaving the rest automatic, or set everything manually and leave just the ISO automatic"
positive,subjective,Dabbling with the manual controls brings forth even better imaging when lighting conditions are less than ideal
positive,subjective,The video is way better than even most of the Sony Alpha DSLR-sized cameras like the Alpha 57 or Alpha 77
positive,subjective,"For those who like automatic functions, you can leave this in full auto mode and get consistently good still shots and awesome video"
positive,subjective,And they're all available via a camera knob or button and can be changed on the fly while shooting video
positive,subjective,Or any other combination of manual and automatic control you desire
positive,objective,"This means you can set your aperture, set your shutter speed, set your white balance to any Kelvin temperature, use manual focus and let the ISO be automatic"
positive,objective,The A6000 gives you complete manual control of each function individually as you wish rather than tying two functions together
positive,subjective,"Now, automatic shooting aside, you bet there will be times when you want to take control"
positive,subjective,"In short, the manual controls offer the ultimate creative image control in a camera you can fit in a large pocket"
positive,objective,"An unusual feature is the ability to pre-program the automatic ASA limits on both the high and low ends anywhere from 100 to 12,800"
positive,objective,"At ASA 12,800 and 1/30 exposure, this camera practically sees in the dark at the expense of some subtle film-like grain"
positive,subjective,It's a really crisp kit lens for all but the most demanding professional uses
positive,subjective,Still images look sharp and crisp with only a tiny hint of softness in the corners if you pixel peep into the image fully
positive,subjective,"Diagonal straight lines show no aliasing stair stepped look when tilted at odd angles, and the kit lens shows no noticeable softness in the edges or chromatic aberrations in videos"
positive,subjective,Image sharpness is very crisp without over processed edges
positive,subjective,"In short, this is the best automatic shooter I've ever used, and I've used hundreds of cameras"
positive,subjective,"Upgrading your lenses, however, yields even more stunning results"
positive,subjective,Chromatic aberration and edge softness are not objectionable even with the kit lens; a result of the camera's firmware ability to correct issues even in the kit lenses
positive,subjective,"It seems to always find perfect focus while being nearly transparent to the video, meaning all you see is a consistently focused image from 12 inches to infinity"
positive,subjective,Auto focus is very smooth and does not hunt and peck in video mode
positive,subjective,"Color saturation is near perfect, color accuracy is just about what your eye sees and the exposure control is very smooth to react to changes in light"
positive,subjective,The video and still imaging created from this camera even using the kit lens is absolutely stunning
positive,objective,"So much technical info is already available on this camera, so I'll get right to the point"
positive,subjective,"8 is so rewarding, I haven;t even bothered to try the Nikon adapter"
positive,objective,The image quality with the 50mm 1
positive,objective,The a6000 has  made photography fun for me again
positive,subjective,Plus my DSLR was too bulky and heavy to have any fun with
negative,subjective,"I have regretted that decision so much, that I only pulled my dslr camera(s) out on special occasions"
positive,subjective,It performs well up to 6400 ISO and goes up to 25600 ISO
positive,objective,It can shoot 11 photos per second and Sony claims it has the world's fastest autofocus
positive ,objective,"It's an awesome little, interchangeable lens, mirrorless camera with a large APS-C size sensor"
negative,objective,If you go this route be sure to get the one specifically made for Sony as the general use one will damage the sensor
positive,objective,If you get dust the first step is to use the in-camera dust removal
positive,subjective,The Sony sensor has a soft cover over the sensor that is very easy to scratch when cleaning off dust
negative,objective,All changeable lens cameras have this issue
negative,subjective,The camera has a tendency to get dust on the sensor when changing lens
positive,objective,When I went to look at the example the camera had THREE pictures; the two I took and one the camera took by itself - when one of the people smiled
positive,objective,The first time I discovered the smile feature I had set the camera to iA (full auto) and snapped off two test shots of a few people
positive,objective,"You can set the camera up to recognize a particular face, ALWAYSE focus on that face as the person moves around the room and automatically take a picture whenever that person smiles"
positive,objective,"Then to quickly switch to , for instance, wildlife - you just select M1 and ALL the saved settings get adjusted"
positive,objective,"You set up the camera for the type of shooting you intend to do and then use the menu to record those settings into memory slot 1, 2 or 3"
positive,objective,"The camera has the ability to ""remember"" three different camera setups"
positive,objective,"For sporting events and wildlife I use the telephoto lens (+ telextender} with a fast shutter speed, area focus and continuous shoring (6 shots/second with focus adjustment)"
positive,objective,For shooting scenery (my forte) I usually use the kit lens at 24mm equivalent (which is fairly wide angle)  and set the camera to a small aperture for maximum depth of field - everything in sharp focus
positive,objective,Everything fits into a Lowepro Event Messenger 100 - a nice compact camera bag
positive,objective,Both lens can use my 49mm circular polarizer and a +3 macro filter
positive,objective,7x telextender that gives the equivalent of 518mm while retaining the fast focus and image stabilization
positive,subjective,The 55-210mm lens is a very inexpensive add-on that produces excellent images especially considering the price
positive,objective,5mm to allow 49mm filters to be used on both lens
positive,subjective,I find it produces very sharp images - the Sony 16-70mm is said to be even sharper (but it costs nearly a thousand dollars by itself)
positive,objective,The 16-50mm lens is a compact lens that extends when the camera is powered on
negative,objective,I tried the available wide angle lens but found I never used them
positive,subjective,Because it is so fast it is possible to shoot fast continuous pictures at 6 shots per second with automatic focus adjustments between each shot
positive,subjective,When shooting fast moving objects such as birds in flight the fast focus finds the target and locks on better than any camera I have ever used
positive,subjective,Focus is fast and accurate using both contrast detect and phase detect
positive,objective,That means I can hand hold the camera in more situations (such as telephoto and low light)
positive,objective,The high speeds combined with the image stabilization means that camera shake is taken entirely out of play
positive,objective,By using the high ISO I can use very high shutter speeds
positive,objective,I shoot ISO 1600 and notice no degradation in my pictures
positive,subjective,With the larger sensor each pixel captures more light so we can use higher ISO settings without penalty
positive,objective,Obviously the APS-C sensor tops the list
positive ,subjective,In this review I will cover some of the camera features that make the camera my favorite
positive,objective,Definitely gives you bang for your buck
positive,objective,The cost of this camera compared to its image quality and ease of use is astonishing
positive,subjective,"Definitely a more pro level feature, but I'm glad it's there"
positive,subjective,4) Memory recall mode is excellent for saving a set of parameters and preferences for different kinds of scenes
positive,objective,It's definitely a step up from the Nex 6's ability to only support IR remotes
positive,subjective,"I use triggertrap on my phone, with the appropriate Sony dongle, and it's a pleasure to use"
positive,objective,3) The microUSB port can now be used to connect to remote triggers
positive,objective,"Sony can still do better, but at least we've moved on from the ghastly system in the Nex6"
positive,subjective,That it comes in such a compact body is even more impressive
positive,objective,"I've handled some pro DSLRs, which have their strengths and weaknesses compared to the autofocus system found here, but the overall system in the A6000 is definitely up there with the best"
positive,subjective,1) the autofocus is pretty much as good as claimed
positive,subjective,"I'd say the A6000 can easily serve the same purpose, but now has some amazing improvements that allow me to stretch my photography skills"
positive,subjective,The NEX 6 was the first semi-pro camera I had and it was an excellent tool to learn the nuances of photography
positive,objective,"In terms of general image quality, portability, low-light capability, etc, this camera is an iterative upgrade on the generally excellent Sony mirrorless cameras"
positive,subjective,So my review will be on the things that dramatically improved
negative,subjective,"It is not slim because of the lens, so I had to &#34;hang&#34; it around my neck and looked more tourist like than I want to"
positive,subjective,The pictures came out beautiful
positive,subjective,Takes great picture at night or under low lighting
positive,objective,I cannot even do manual focus efficiently with my Canon 5D Mark3 which is over 6 times more expensive than the Sony A6000
positive,subjective,Sony 's manual focus aid is the best in the industry IMO
positive,objective,But you can always get away with legacy manual focus lenses if you don't need autofocus
positive,subjective,Their Zeiss lenses are among the best yet expensive
negative,subjective,The only thing I would complain is that the shutter on the A6000 is much louder than my other A3000
positive,subjective,"The setup is so compact, light, and discreet"
positive,objective,That saves me some space in my camera bag
negative,subjective,"With the A6000 fast frame rate, that becomes unnecessary unless you are making long exposures"
positive,objective,The resulting photos came out very natural and you could even do it handheld as the Bionz X processor has the intelligence to do image alignment
positive,subjective,"Speaking of which, I absolutely love the Sony built-in HDR function"
positive,objective,This makes it easier for me to shoot under a high contrast situation
positive,objective,The RAW files from the A6000 have more latitude to push shadows in post without revealing any color banding noise unlike my Canon
positive,objective,$200 is a big drop forthe A6000 and I can tell you its CMOS sensor is far better than any Canon sensor at the same APS-C size
positive,objective,All these additional features and the price justify the A6000 over the A3000 if you ask me today
positive,subjective,The tilted LCD screen is also very helpful if I need to raise my camera to shoot with a crowd in front of me
positive,subjective,"However, the A6000 has far better resolution on the EVF than its A3000 sibling"
positive,objective,All their bodies have focus peaking and magnification with one touch of a button
negative,objective,"If you are not into sports or wildlife, manual focus is a breeze with the Sony"
positive,subjective,I myself have a Metabones Canon FD lens adapter and it works very well with the Sony E mount bodies
positive,subjective,"Because Sony E mount body has such a short flange distance, you can literally mount any legacy lens with an appropriate adapters"
positive,subjective,It 's perfect for street photography with a prime lens on it
positive,subjective,Its body shape is also less DSLR like and looks just like a rangefinder
negative,objective,Hauling a DSLR makes my shoulder hurts
positive,subjective,The opportunity of adding a Sony came when I looked for a compact camera I could carry for those long hikes and international travels
positive,subjective,The list could go on and on and other reviewers have already mentioned some of its great features
positive,objective,I myself have already owned the entry level A3000 and that was another good bargain
negative,objective,This camera has just been released a little over a year ago and its price has dropped to a bargain level at $448 recently
positive ,subjective,"Very capable and complex camera, but with enough 'how-to&#34; videos if you persevere,you can master it"
positive,subjective,It fits nicely
positive,objective,"I wanted a black lens, but Sony didn't allow to mix and match, but I realize it looks fine since there is a touch of black because the face of the lens is black"
positive,objective,So I went with the silver body with the black grip and I think the black and silver contrast looks awesome
negative,objective,"I do wish the Sony had touch screen like the 70D, but I'm sure that's down the line"
positive,objective,"As your eye approaches the viewfinder, it automatically senses and switches accordingly"
positive,objective,One feature I really like is how you don't have to choose between the viewfinder or the screen
negative,objective,"I don't have a keen eye for picture differences, nor am I that picky"
negative,objective,"Anyway, I'm coming from the Canon 70D, before that, the 60D and lugging a full size dslr around started to feel cumbersome"
positive,subjective,This is a great camera for advanced photographs or amateurs looking for the Ferrari of point and shoots
positive ,objective,Great camera for video and photos
positive ,subjective,"Excellent camera is superb all you can do with this a6000, I recommend it to everyone who wants to have a good camera without breaking your pocket, since no photographs to profecionales"
negative,objective,There is a lack of lenses for the system but Sony seems to be working on getting more released and hopefully other makers will too
negative,objective,I also have to wonder why there is no 720p option
positive,objective,I can see someone trying to show grandma some videos from this and being frustrated
positive,subjective,"I would much rather use MP4 since most things will recognize it, many don't with AVCHD"
positive,objective,While with AVCHD you get 5 choices 1)60i 24M (FX) 2
positive,subjective,I want a regular one that I can grab any old cheap mic and toss on it for a lot better sound than the built in one
positive,objective,I have been getting into street photography a great deal
positive,objective,"However many pro's have been switching to this camera and while I may not be a pro myself, I do think of myself as a wannabe pro and there are many times a silent shutter would be nice"
negative,objective,"I just don't understand why anyone would make a camera like this these days that you could not shut it up, even most cheap P&S; do that"
negative,objective,"The first one, and it is a rather big one for me, that's the lack of a silent shutter mode"
positive,subjective,"And I even like the color, the silver and black is really very handsome on it"
positive,subjective,The grip on it works well compared to other makes and models where it seems you will drop it
positive,subjective,I will say I love how light and compact this thing is
negative,subjective,"Hey, I call them like I see them good or bad and that lens was horrible, this camera on the other hand rocks"
positive,objective,"No, there are some things I would like changed but for 448 dollars, what more do you want"
positive,objective,"When I want to shoot candids, snapshot or portraits with natural light this camera delivers"
negative,subjective,"I wish it were a lower MP camera, something like 16 or 12 so it would perform better at higher ISO's"
negative,objective,"I had hoped they would have improved the kit lens from the NEX 6, they didn't"
negative,subjective,What I don't like: The kit lens is a complete turd
positive,subjective,Had wifi ability and you can control this camera with your phone through a free app from sony
positive,subjective,With an adapter it can take old film lenses which is pretty cool also
positive,subjective,"Auto Focus is blazing fast, got a 11 fps burst more and in a camera that is light and small"
positive,subjective,"Images from the camera are clean, crisp with good colors"
negative,subjective,I can't recommend this camera enough especially at it's new price
positive,subjective,"Despite this handicap, the a6000's video capabilities are still great in my opinion - very high quality under the right conditions"
negative,subjective,The one thing that I'm truly disappointed about is Sony's continual refusal to add an XAVC S codec for video when the a5100 has it
positive,objective,"With a new Sony lens, I can only imagine just how great the AF will be"
negative,objective,"I haven't had much success with tracking or lock-on, but I haven't tried very much either"
positive,objective,"8 DN lens (the newest version,) and still the autofocus is blisteringly quick and accurate in most lighting conditions"
positive,objective,I've only used the Sigma 30mm f2
positive,objective,"Focus peaking, DMF, 11FPS continuous, a number of AEB options, zebra, and truly excellent continuous focus are just a few of this cameras many great features"
positive,objective,"However, that might be because I'm coming from a camera with as many features as you can count on one hand"
negative,objective,"The one caveat is the record button, which is on the outside of the thumb rest"
positive,objective,") I'm still not quite used to the button placement after so long with my D3100, but things make a lot of sense"
positive,subjective,"For a small camera, it is very comfortable (and I have big hands"
positive,objective,"The low light performance is miles beyond the D3100, and I would venture to say probably among the best APS-C low light performers"
positive,subjective,The image quality is superb
positive,subjective,"But I've been able to replace both my SLR and my video camera, so it's been very economical overall"
positive,subjective,I do have one important recommendation: Buy Gary Fong's video called &#34;Unleashing the power of your Sony a6000
positive,subjective,It takes incredible pictures and great videos
positive,subjective,I'm sure it's an excellent camera and I would have been very pleased with it if I had taken some classes or read a lot of books
positive,subjective,"&#34;  That is, take excellent photos AND videos"
positive,subjective,Some of the other cameras in this league would be more than that for just body and crappy kit lens
positive,objective,Looking forward to the upgraded 16-50 lens
positive,objective,I have included a couple of pictures I shot with this camera and did very little processing to them
positive,subjective,"Depending on the lens you are shooting with, the speed of the focus will either be super fast, or in the case of the kit lens, it will be a bit sluggish"
positive,objective,I have been impressed with the depth and quality of the color it produces
positive,subjective,"It produces 24 megapixel raw images very fast, and very well"
positive ,objective,They are inexpensive and will allow you to quickly charge your batteries
negative,objective,"If you by this camera, I suggest you buy a separate charger and a few extra batteries"
positive,objective,"As for charging, they do provide a USB charging cable that requires charging to be done with the battery in the camera"
positive,objective,This camera uses the same batteries as the NEX 5 cameras
positive,subjective,"Because of the low price and many nice features, it appears that Sony cut corners by eliminating the chargers"
negative,objective,A negative is that they didn't provide a 110/12volt charger
positive,subjective,More testing will be necessary but so far this inexpensive camera is very impressive
positive,objective,They camera seems to be noise free up to about 3200 ISO
positive,subjective,The processed images are beautiful and the onboard stabilization seem to work quite well
positive,objective,So far we are loving these cameras and have already taken several pictures with different light levels
positive,objective,"I did a lot of research and the 11 frames per second, 25k ISO, view finder and the super auto focus got my attention"
negative,objective,1/3 Fstop with only 3 shots in the bracket set
negative,subjective,"Prior to this purchase we were using Sony NEX 5 cameras as our backup cameras but we weren't happy with the limited bracketing capabilities, i"
positive ,objective,This was one of the best investments I have made in a long time and I'm delighted by this camera's size and capability
positive,objective,"I find that when I ask a stranger if I can take their photo, they are more inclined to say yes because this little camera is not intimidating"
positive,subjective,So I am getting shots that would not have been possible before
positive,subjective,"The kit lens is not as sharp as my Canon lenses, but for me it is a worthwhile trade off"
negative,objective,I had some problems with the focus of the first copy so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement
positive,subjective,Without question the best point-and-shoot I've ever used
positive,subjective,"Overall, this camera takes great pictures with little effort"
positive,objective,The camera has a digital viewfinder that pops out for easy viewing and it auto detects when your eye comes close to the camera and switches it off so that you can look manually
positive,objective,"It makes sending pictures to my phone really simple, and I can share them easily and quickly when I'm traveling without my computer and still want to share my photos"
negative,objective,"For example, I was taking a picture of the ocean but the waves were moving too quickly and it was almost impossible to get the panorama shot no matter how many times I tried"
negative,subjective,"I don't use it that often, but when I do it is a little frustrating"
negative,objective,The only setting that sometimes gives me problems is the panorama setting - it is really finicky and many times struggles to take it if there is too much movement in the picture
positive,subjective,I've played with most of the settings and they are easy to use and produce stunning pictures
positive,subjective,And work well they do
positive,objective,I'm not a professional photographer by any means - I usually use it on the scene functions and rely on them to work well
positive,objective,"Since I use this camera mostly for travel photography, I don't play too much with the functions and rely on the camera to take the best possible pictures"
positive,subjective,"I couldn't believe how fast it took the picture in the beginning, but I love that it saves me time because I don't have to struggle with the camera trying to focus even in low light situations"
positive,subjective,The autofocus and shutter speed on this camera is no joke - it's fast
negative,objective,Carrying around a clunky DSLR while I was traveling so often was getting old
positive,objective,"My main reason for buying this camera is because I wanted something with a smaller, more portable body while still having as close to DSLR quality as possible"
negative,objective,I timed it; the battery went from 67% to 33% in 60 mins
negative,subjective,Battery life is awful
negative,objective,Not so great lens selection and pretty expensive
positive,subjective,High quality shots
negative,subjective,"lightweight, small, looks like a point and shoot doesn't attract attention"
positive,objective,nearly instant upload to social networking and my phone (note 4)
positive,objective,Exposure simulation right in the viewfinder so I can spend all my time looking at my subject and changing my exposure
positive,objective,I can use any flash
positive,subjective,i take a lot of pictures of deer in fields the zoom is awesome
positive ,subjective,"great package deal, I like everthing about this camera"

positive,subjective,*** Very light and ergonomic design
positive,subjective,*** All other standard software features are available
positive,objective,*** Ability to keep the flash off in any and every situation (a manual switch is provided)
positive,subjective,*** High resolution

positive,objective,*** The camera offers so much in terms of resolution and optical magnification that most users need to learn afresh that a powerful tool can be used in unbelievable way
positive,objective,"*** It offer 20+ Mega-pixel resolution, something that can do wonders"
positive,objective,"In fact the moment I read the specification and the Sony name, I sold my non Sonly Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera, removable lens, and telephoto lens (puchased for a futune) at a loss and bought this model"
positive,objective,"2 mega pixels, but with its 16x optical magnification it did wonders for me"
positive,objective,The highest resolution was only 1
positive,objective,5 inch floppy disks to store pictures
positive,objective,Also the extra battery and charger
positive,objective,32 GB memory included
positive,objective,This camera came with everything pictured
positive,subjective,Pictures were not blurry

positive,subjective,I LOVE MY NEW CAMERA- I AM STILL PLAYING WITH IT TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE FEATURES BUT THE PHOTOS ARE BEAUTIFUL
positive ,objective,I love the zoom and quality of the pictures
positive,objective,"It is 2013 model, however, for $50 more, u can get HX400 if you need all the extras (WiFi, GPS, lens sensor, etc)"
positive,objective,I prefer this over HX400 since it is much simpler menu items
positive,subjective,Simple to use
positive,subjective,Many features that allow anyone to take wonderful photographs
positive,subjective,A very user friendly and useful camera
positive,subjective,A very capable camera for a slightly less capable photographer
positive,subjective,"So far, the few pictures that I've taken are excellent"
positive,subjective,I love the zoom feature and the clarity of all the pictures I take
positive,subjective,I love all the features and that this package comes with everything I need and can think of including an extra battery and charger
positive,subjective,Great mid size camera
positive,subjective,My experience is that the battery life is very good

positive ,objective,"It is also a lot lighter than many cameras this size, but has a great grip and feels good in your hands"
positive,subjective,I love how the LCD screen pulls out and pivots which is really handy when using the timer/tripod for pictures
positive ,objective,"First of all, all the accessories are fantastic - 3 batteries, case, strap, lens cover, 32 gb card, tripod, car charger"
positive,subjective,"It's hard to manually hold the camera stable enough for zooms that significant, but that's not a negative at all"
positive,objective,And I've got a full-size tripod to take full advantage of the 50x zoom
positive,objective,"The case easily stores it all, including the mini tripod"
positive,subjective,"Haven't had the camera for long so far, but it's already been used to take some amazing pictures"
positive,subjective,"Is more than what I was expecting, I love this camera and the things that come with it are very useful"
positive,subjective,Even the professional photographer in the group couldn't get over on how well the pictures it took with a built in lens

positive,objective,THE GPS IS WHAT I NEED FOR MY WORK Y MY TRIPS
positive ,objective,"The screen is a bit small and dim, but once the pictures/videos are uploaded to my computer, the quality is amazing"
positive,subjective,"I have yet to use the WiFi, I'm sure it would be useful"
positive,subjective,The on screen help is intuitive

positive,subjective,than choosing night mode which creates blur images if not handles properly
positive,subjective,"nice exposure control dial  i use it for every shot i take in low light conditions , super handy feature"
positive,subjective,"Takes awesome picture of the moon with its texture and craters, the optical zoom is best and stable"
positive,subjective,I wanted zoom and I got it
positive,subjective,If you are interested in big zoom in a little camera you will not be disappointed

positive,objective,It also does MP4 which is important if you are going to post or otherwise share videos
positive,subjective,HD mode is awesome
positive,objective,Taking movies was also a plus
positive,objective,There are also other modes to cover special circumstances (Low light mode without tripod was great) including food and soft skin (why
positive,subjective,The intelligent auto mode was really effective in taking almost any type of picture

positive,subjective,good price
positive,subjective,easy to use
positive,objective,I am hoping to get better at taking these shots by tweaking settings and my camera holding technique
positive,subjective,This camera is lighter with more zoom and it seems to be able to take some indoor zoom shots with less blurring

positive,subjective,so small and the zoom works ok indoors too
positive,objective,Where does Amazon get their information from
negative,objective,"Exact measurements of this particular camera were vital to get a case that would fit just right, Amazon's measurement of cases strangely seem to be only for the outside of a case and INSIDE measurements (i"
positive ,subjective,"The small package is fantastic, and the handling is pretty decent"
negative,objective,"Another minor quibble is that when using the WiFi control, you're unable to change expositiveure, ISO, aperture, expositiveure time, etc"
negative,objective,The biggest complaint I would have is that the screen is really difficult to see in full sun
positive ,objective,"The wide angle lens has been great for taking interior shots, and the bokeh effect is easy to achieve"
positive ,objective,It has made picture taking easy
positive,subjective,The price is good
positive,subjective,It works excellent in low light condition
positive,subjective,It takes great pictures and movies
positive,subjective,"Videos look great, too"
positive,subjective,LCD screen is bright and clear
positive,subjective,very powerful and handy for simple point and shoots
positive,objective,"it is a little larger than the panasonic, but it still fits into jeans pockets and jackets"
positive,objective,it does have a lot of features and can also be used in a point and shoot mode
positive,objective,panasonic has leica lenses for their cameras and sony's zeiss is an equivalent
positive,subjective,the zoom is powerful and stays clear in the zoom mode
positive,subjective,the zeiss lens is outstanding
positive,objective,"while taking action shots indoors and holding up the camera to get over the heads of people, several people asked how it was so crystal clear"
positive,subjective,this sony is so much better at 20mp and the images on the screen are better than outstanding
positive,subjective,the old panasonic was very clear at 12mp
positive,objective,there is a controversy about more mp for a clearer photo
positive,objective,"NP-BX1 is the battery here  with 1240 mAh in case you're looking to purchase extra batteries, which I always do"
positive,objective,Another favorite setup of mine is to carry the NEX6 with a couple of lenses and the RX100M2 when travelling to Europe for easier portability
positive,objective,My RX100M2 gets those better quality pictures because of its bigger sensor
positive,subjective,A bigger zoom
positive,subjective,"Compared to my RX100M2, this camera has a better hand-grip"
positive,objective,Especially since the image stabilization works best up to 30x in this type of camera
positive,objective,And this camera for its 30x zoom
positive,objective,I bought this mostly for its 30x zoom in a compact body which my RX100M2 lacked
positive,subjective,As I learn to manage the digital format and the wonders of this camera I hope to make nature images of the type I formerly made with a medium format film camera
positive,subjective,I saw what looked like well lit images without a flash
positive,subjective,"No grain, or in digital speak &#34;noise&#34;"
positive,objective,I accidentally made a couple of exposures indoors in extremely poor lighting and was stunned to see the quality of those accidental images
positive,subjective,I like having control of exposures again
positive,objective,I think the hot shoe on top for a professional flash unit adds to the value of this camera
positive,subjective,Very easy download to iPhoto (I am an Apple addict)
positive,subjective,I love the camera - 20 Mp &amp; 30 Zoom - VERY compact yet easy to hold in hand
positive,subjective,"The flash tilts back, great for photographing without bouncing light back into the lens"
positive,subjective,Out side of that it has taken great pictures the video quality is also great
negative,subjective,I almost sent it back because it started going crazy on me the pictures kept on changeing for no apparent reason
positive ,subjective,I love it and hope it isn't plagued with the grinding lens syndrome all my previous camera have had
positive,subjective,Even the digital 60x zoom is better than I expected
positive,subjective,The 30 x zoom is awesome and crisp
positive,objective,Especially if you spend alot of time at sporting events for kids and want those close up pictures
positive,subjective,"If you choose to carry a smaller camera that takes great pictures, this one is a good choice"
positive,subjective,"Even though I have taken hundreds of pictures, they are for fun and family"
positive,subjective,Video is in HD and comes out really clean
positive,objective,I use this as much for a camcorder as a camera and never miss a funny or special moment
positive,objective,WHILE you are recording you can take snap shots
positive,objective,At ANY time you can click the video button and start recording
positive,subjective,"My favorite feature, as with the previous model, is the video function"
positive,objective,I will have to add some pictures once I am home again
positive,objective,Quick shutter speed
positive,subjective,I love the 10 picture setting where I can click 10 pictures withing seconds
positive,subjective,The pictures of my kids and great nephews are wonderful
positive,subjective,I took it to the rodeo and got great shots of the performer and the riders
positive,objective,I love being able to stick this in a very small purse and drag it around everywhere
positive ,objective,It has some better features than the previous and I also bought the additional flash to attach
positive,objective,"Since I am familiar with most of the settings, it is like home"
positive,subjective,Then I realized I took more pictures with it because it was easier to pull out and use and the pictures come out perfectly
positive,subjective,"At first, it was along with my larger &#34;better and more expensive&#34; camera"
positive,objective,I would recommend this camera for everyday picture taking for sure
positive ,objective,"Takes wonderful pictures, and fits in your shirt pocket as we'll"
positive,objective,A little Camera that will do any thing that you can do in photography
positive,objective,The Best Small Camera That Money Can Buy
positive,subjective,The battery life is very long and this camera is easy to carry with a neck strap
positive,subjective,"I am more than happy with this camera, works perfectly, I find no cons about this product"
positive,subjective,Well worth the money
positive,subjective,Picture clarity at 20 MP is awesome
positive,objective,Lots of cool features inc Gps that I didn't know about
negative,subjective,If this is the smallest P&S; it couldn't be by much even in comparison with my SAMSUNG
negative,subjective,I can't believe it would take much to put threads on the lens so that filters could be used
negative,objective,"I will be looking for the window for changing time periods for length of viewing photos, etc"
positive,objective,let's try for f18 or at least f11
positive,objective,The f-stop only goes to f8
negative,objective,NEED TO COME DOWN ON THE PRICE FOR THE EXTERNAL FLASH now half the cost of the camera
positive,objective,Believe this: Sony would match the Amazon price but convenience in the purchase process suggested Amazon
negative,subjective,Mayabe eventually it will have a viewfinder
positive,subjective,The case sony makes for this camera fits perfectly as well
positive ,objective,"The camera has excellent zoom, it is easy to use and gets good quality photos"
positive,objective,Auto focus works for most of my pics
positive,subjective,And with small processors that work with them are able to use digital trickery to get more out of them
positive,subjective,The reason that we can get as much performance as we do out of tiny sensors is that they tend to be more efficient at processing light than larger sensors
positive,subjective,I didn'the realize it would even be possible with a small sensor camera
negative,subjective,"In practical terms what this means is that if you want to get a photo with a subject that is in focus and a background which has an attractive blur (known as ""bokeh"")"
positive,objective,3 but is actually f-stop 8
negative,subjective,One of the most popular positive reviews on Amazon laments the loss of the higher f-stops which he mistakenly believed was 6
positive,objective,6 as advertised by Sony so the equivalent f-stop is 3
negative,objective,"It is the actual dimensions of the aperture not ""f-stop"" that largely determines depth of focus"
positive,objective,Photographers pay huge amounts of money for lenses that have as wide an aperture as possible
positive,subjective,"However photographers covet a shallow depth of field for beautiful portraits, close-ups and artistic control over the image"
positive,subjective,having most of the picture in focus is desirable
positive,objective,"For pictures of landscapes, mountains and many other types of scenes"
negative,subjective,If you have a smaller opening more of the picture is in focus
negative,objective,less of the picture is in focus
positive,objective,"The opening size controls not only how much light can pass through the lens in a given amount of time, but also the depth of focus or field"
positive,objective,"The numbers on the two lenses above are the same, so one would assume that the openings would be the same size, but this is not the case"
positive,objective,This is referring to the aperture which is how wide the blades that control how much light passes through the camera can open
positive,objective,"3"" which on both lenses is referring to the maximum ""f-stop"" for the lens at full wide angle and full zoom"
negative,objective,"The numbers that people have a harder time with are the ""3,5-6,3"" and the ""3"
negative,objective,"and they are, but of course at this time they still cannot match the performance of a much larger sensor"
negative,subjective,Small sensors must be much more sensitive than the larger sensors
negative,subjective,I think that it is fairly obvious to everyone that a tiny sensor is going to be working with a lot less light
positive,subjective,"There are excellent articles discussing this if you search for ""Full Frame Equivalence"" in a search engine"
positive,objective,That is one of the primary reasons why in this time of miniaturized everything you still see photographers running around with giant cameras with massively large lenses
positive,objective,A narrow depth of field is one of the primary tools that photographers use to create beautiful artistic photos
positive,objective,"This obviously helps with their low light capabilities, but even more importantly from an artistic perspective"
positive,subjective,Cameras with larger sensors take larger lenses that have larger apertures and they can collect much more light
positive,subjective,A camera with a small sensor currently cannot do everything that a camera with a large sensor can do
positive,subjective,Also the digital trickery that the tiny computer inside the camera is able to perform to get the most out of the sensor is quite amazing as well
positive,subjective,it is obviously much more efficient with the smaller amount of light it is sampling than larger sensors are
positive,subjective,The technology behind the sensor on this little camera is quite amazing
positive,objective,A full size 720mm lens would be very large and expensive and I am unaware of any that can go full wide angle as the one that comes on this camera can
positive,subjective,It is the small sensor that makes it possible for this camera to have the huge amount of zoom that it does
positive,subjective,"So that is kind of the end of my review, but I also wanted to discuss large sensor vs small sensor cameras"
positive,subjective,And the extra features are quite amazing also and surprisingly useful
positive,subjective,"Instead of feeling disappointed that we failed to capture the essence that we were hoping for we seem to be saying ""wow"" that is almost as good as being there"
positive,subjective,The pictures actually come out looking better than you expect that they will much of the time
positive,subjective,It is small enough that when you see something that you wish you could take a picture of you might just have it with you
positive,subjective,which if you haven't taken hundreds of photos can be convenient
positive,objective,Of course you can also upload to your computer through wifi as well
positive,subjective,I didn't realize that it could also display a slide show on our HDTV wirelessly through our Sony Blu-Ray player
positive,objective,Then the picture you take is instantly uploaded
positive,objective,You can also control the shutter and zoom from your phone while seeing the scene live
positive,objective,My wife set up a display at a museum recently and it was very nice to show her the pictures in a larger format while we were still there
positive,subjective,As it turns out it is extremely convenient to be able to send your images from your camera to your phone or tablet when you are out and about
positive,subjective,One of the features that I didn't realize would be useful for us was the wifi
positive,objective,This also allows one to get clear images in low light
positive,objective,Some of the HDR features can be used to make the pictures turn out clearer than with image stabilization alone
positive,objective,I usually put the camera on a tripod if I want good results in full zoom
positive,objective,"My A65 has good in body stabilization also, but my longest lens is 300mm"
positive,objective,The images turned out great handheld without a tripod
positive,objective,I was able to take pictures from the Space Needle of ships and cranes at the Port of Seattle approximately two miles away for a friend of mine
positive,objective,Most impressive of course is the zoom lens combined with the great image stabilization
positive,objective,To get it to work one most first open the internal flash with the camera in a mode that will use the flash
positive,objective,The TTL works with this camera as well firing off a test flash to a asses the lighting and adjust the power of the flash
positive,objective,I have been using an inexpensive flash that works with the automatic TTL features with my Sony A65
positive,objective,This feature is far more handy than most people might realize
positive,objective,I bought an adapter so that I can use a third party external flash and also my radio flash trigger that can set off multiple flashes simultaneously
positive,objective,"You press the button, it takes several pictures using different settings and combines them to give you a better picture than the sensor would normally be capable of taking"
positive,objective,The HX50V has in camera HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing that works incredibly well
positive,objective,"Because of the camera's relatively deep depth of field, focusing for video is not as much of a challenge for it"
positive,subjective,The videos are also incredible
positive,subjective,The camera just takes excellent photos
positive,subjective,So my feeling was that we did not need or even want another small camera
positive,subjective,"Our other smaller cameras, cell phones, and tablets take pictures that are acceptable for many types of occasions"
positive,objective,"But it gets to be too much work, so lately for both pictures and videos my favorite device is the Sony SLT-A65 camera for which I have a number of capable lenses and accessories"
negative,objective,I am almost embarrassed to admit that we have several HD camcorders; sometimes I hand hold one and simultaneously record on a couple others that are set up on tripods and then combine the footage
positive,subjective,"All three shoot ""HD Video"" and when we purchased them we were happy with all of them"
positive,subjective,"The photos are very clear, even at high zoom levels, and as for size, not to bad"
positive,objective,"So I went with the larger HX50V and wow, I'm impressed"
positive,subjective,I not a big fan of larger camera's but decided I wanted something that would have greater zoom capabilities with better quality photos
positive,objective,Great all around camera with just enough manual control to satisfy the hard core tinkerers
positive,objective,It has great built in effects as well as direction selectable panoramic mode
positive,objective,The camera is controllable from the ground via Sony playmemories mobile app
positive,objective,"The steady cam feature together with my brushless gimbal, deliver a smooth and steady video"
positive,subjective,"I had read many great reviews, saw a good opportunity and am now using this camera as my go to daily shooter"
positive,subjective,It's a fantastic camera with a lot of fantastic features
positive ,objective,"I love this feature, and the camera could keep track of GPS all the time to give instant positiveitioning"
negative,objective,"European models don't include GPS, beware"
negative,objective,"For some odd reason, only the American version includes both the wifi and the GPS"
positive,subjective,"Low light pictures are great, and most of the time you don't need the flash"
positive,objective,"I don't use movies much, but is works fine, and you can zoom in and out while filming"
positive,objective,"Battery life is more than enough for me, and able to take hundreds of pictures a day"
negative,objective,"The only thing is that being wide angle, it distorts unzoomed pictures at short distance"
positive,subjective,Perfect successor to other super-zoom Sony cameras
positive,subjective,"Use it as intended (daylight, low ISO) and it works perfectly"
positive ,objective,"This is a small-sensor, high-resolution camera that will struggle to focus and will produce noise in low light"
positive,subjective,"At 38mm thick, this is considerably fatter than either the Nikon or the Panasonic"
positive,subjective,- Bulkiest 30x compact travel zoom
positive,objective,- Cheapest of the three (purchased at $247)
positive,subjective,"- 1080p 60fps video with smooth, variable zoom speed"
positive,objective,"- Good ergonomics &amp; controls, including an exposure compensation dial and custom function button"
positive,subjective,In-camera panorama creation that works well in wide open spaces / landscapes
positive,objective,That extra 1mm at the wide end makes more difference than an extra 30mm at the Tele end
positive,objective,"- 24-720mm, not 25-750mm equivalent"
positive,objective,"In good light (which is all these cameras can handle anyway), the additional detail is well resolved"
positive,subjective,The option to have my pictures wireless is great
positive ,objective,"I like this camera very much, the zoon is amazing, the video is also great"
negative,subjective,"I hoped to be able to use this feature way more, but it's faster to view the pictures by just plugging in"
negative,subjective,I don't like the way the wireless feature has to re-map out all of the folders every single time in order to view them
positive,objective,"So far, I just skip it and use Windows folder to view/transfer pictures"
positive,objective,I'm still trying to get the hang of the photo downloading software that comes with it
positive,subjective,"As for the software, I'd give it 3 stars, if possible"
positive,subjective,"It would have been very helpful to have a paper manual for this one, rather than accessing it online"
positive,objective,"1 MP, and the difference is night and day"
positive,subjective,Zoom is the best feature
positive,subjective,This camera takes excellent pictures and highly recommend
positive,subjective,Not to big and not to small
positive,subjective,Excellent zoom
positive,subjective,Best compact camera ever
positive,subjective,"I would definitely recommend this camera to a friend, and maybe consider buying another one for myself to control remotely if I can find some money for it"
positive,subjective,"So many people take photos with their smart phones today, but know if you get this camera you are definitely getting a better product"
positive,subjective,Transferring photos with the sony play memories app can be a little cumbersome the first couple times before you are used to it
negative,objective,Can't transfer video taken with the camera via wifi
negative,subjective,(gripe that I can live with)The camera is a little fatter than a lot of point and shoot subcompacts and not quite small enough to fit in your front pants pocket
negative,objective,(Biggest gripe) The time in between photos is not quite as fast as I would have liked when shooting on the highest quality setting
positive,subjective,"Loads of photo options most of which as a casual photo taker, (I don't own a SLR), I may never use, but nice to know those features are available to me if I want to use some day"
positive,objective,Let's you capture hight speed sports action
positive,objective,"Burst photo taking, up to 10 photos in 1 sec"
positive,subjective,(this is a non camera feature but still cool
positive,objective,GPS tracking feature that let's you track you steps
positive,subjective,"cool feature when viewing on a tablet, or uploading to a social media site"
positive,objective,"GPS tracking of photos, tells you where you were when the photos were taken"
positive,objective,on the highest quality setting photo size is around 3MB
positive,subjective,"Photo size, (mb), is not too large"
positive,subjective,The 180 and 360 degree panoramic photos you can take is also a cool feature
positive,subjective,Nice feature
positive,objective,"Also, with the app you can control the camera remotely"
positive,subjective,Once you get it going it transfers photos very fast
positive,objective,Transferring photos via wifi using the sony Play memories app to smart phones and tablets is a 21st century feature that lets you easily share photos with friends and family
positive,subjective,I haven't used my dedicated HD camcorder since owning the new photo camera because the quality is comparable
positive,subjective,Very viable HD camcorder substitute
positive,subjective,The crazy fantastic 30x optical zoom
positive,subjective,I have never needed to use the flash and photos look great
positive,subjective,The low light photos are outstanding and true to life
positive,subjective,The most impressive features of this camera are:
positive,subjective,This is the best point and shoot camera I have owned
positive,subjective,Cheap price a+
positive,subjective,But that is a very minor issue compared to the great things about this camera
negative,subjective,The only complaint I have with it is the placement of the movie mode button
positive,objective,Ease of changing ISO enables low light situations without the use of flash
positive,subjective,Excellent zoom with clarity
positive,subjective,"Obviously I'm not a photographer or a technical person, so I feel confident that anyone can use this camera to take great pictures if I can do it"
positive,subjective,I'm sure there are chargers or battery packs that charge faster but it did the job
positive,subjective,I also had a battery pack that I use for my iPhone but it charged this camera as well which was highly convenient (Anker?? Astro 5600mAh Portable External Battery Charger)
negative,subjective,Get a bigger one if you want to take anything but the camera and cord and maybe a memory card or two
positive,objective,"I had about 4 hours of high definition footage and hundreds of high resolution photos and used up about 20 GB of space, so a 32 GB card did well for me (Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS32GSDHC10E))"
positive,objective,"Definitely get a memory card, so you don't have to decrease the definition and resolution (or worse, delete your stuff) for reasons of space"
positive,subjective,"-It's pretty teeny and compact so it didn't take up much space in the small bag I had and I didn't have to set it down between videos, and it was always ready to go"
positive,subjective,"-The motion stabilization features meant that I didn't have very many blurry pictures, and this was in rapidly changing natural lighting at an outdoor venue, with a lot of intense stage lights as well, and fast moving performers"
positive,objective,"-The zoom is outstanding, a little less clear with the digital than the optical, but the optical is so close I didn't have to use the digital hardly at all"
positive,subjective,"I am terrible at photography, so I expected my pictures to be mediocre, but this camera did all the work, and the pictures were so good I got accused of stealing professional photos"
positive ,objective,"Easy to use, very portable, and the battery lasts for a long time"
positive,subjective,"At this price, you aren't going to find the &#34;perfect&#34; camera"
negative,objective,I find the auto-focus to be a little slow
positive,objective,"I just pop the flash when I start the camera, and if the camera doesn't need it, it won't use it"
positive,subjective,This isn't a HUGE problem because the camera takes pretty good pictures if you forget
positive,subjective,its a very versatile point-and-shoot
positive,subjective,"At this price point, this is one of the nicer super-zooms you can buy"
positive ,objective,"The Scene mode allows a little greater control for specific situations (Portraits, Night shots, etc), but is still simple enough to understand that a person could pick it up pretty quickly"
positive,subjective,I like the Smart Auto and Superior Auto settings because I can hand the camera to an electronically-challenged person and it pretty much does all the thinking for them
positive,subjective,"After owning mostly Canon products, it took me a couple of hours of going through all the menus, and options before I was comfortable finding everything"
positive,subjective,"The buttons are where you expect them to be, and work like you'd think"
positive,subjective,"It has many great features, and there is one I especially love, which is being able to take pictures while I'm recording"
positive,subjective,Its zoom  is great
positive,subjective,This camera worked perfectly for me to capture wildlife even when it was moving or was very far
positive,subjective,"I love Sony, picture quality is great on all Sony cameras, even the older models"
positive,subjective,Very nice gadget with lots of nice features
negative,objective,I think that the only negative is that it is not easy to hold without pressing buttons by accident
positive,subjective,The zoom is great for such a compact body
positive,subjective,I use my camera weekly so I'm definitely getting my money's worth
positive,objective,This was a steal considering the retail price of nearly $350
positive,objective,00 with shipping
positive,subjective,The video function is good and offers slow motion playback as well
negative,subjective,"It's not a true pocket camera unless you have big pockets, but it will do"
positive,subjective,If you like to take a variety of images this is a great little camera
positive,objective,Now I have them up on my Mac at home they are clear and well focused
positive,objective,"I have moved to it from my SLR &#34;kit bag&#34; and shot 5,000 images on the last trip"
negative,objective,"The only problem i have with these is that because they are on-ear, my earlobes are under the cushions, and after an hour I will take off the headphones and my ears will feel funny"
positive ,objective,"They're closed headphones, so you get some nice bass that you don't find with open headphones like most Sennheiser's"
positive,objective,"i saw these Sony headphones at target, tried them and they sound like beats"
positive,subjective,"My son has a pair of Beats by Dre headphones, i love the way they sound"
positive,subjective,Really good quality sound is great as good as the beats by dre will buy again in the near future
positive,objective,One drawback is that they cord is not a removable cord and does not have ipod controls
positive,subjective,"80 dollars is a bit on the pricey side, but being a dedicated Sony fan, that's something I'm willing to put up with"
positive ,subjective,"Aside from that, these headphones are awesome, they do the job for me"
negative,objective,These ARE on-ear headphones and they have a bit of a squeeze to them
positive,objective,"And as for the squeaking sound, I don't have a single bit of that problem"
positive,objective,Sony never fails when it comes to sound output quality
positive,subjective,The sound quality is as good as everyone claim it to be
positive,subjective,I would recommend these over Beats because these sound better and are 1/4 the price
positive,subjective,you will not find any headphones that are better than these for under $100
positive,subjective,these are really good headphones for a really good price
positive,objective,At least not for the price
positive,subjective,My opinion they are comparable to the beats for one third the price
positive ,subjective,ok sony makes xb headphones well i donnot like alot of bass in my music
positive,subjective,"The fit is good, they adjust to all sizes"
positive,subjective,"I tested different headphones an in my opinion these headphones sounded better than Beats by Dre, Ludacris, or skull candy"
positive,subjective,"I played current top 40, rock, R&B;, soul, ballads, dance, disco, salsa, merengue, acoustic, and music from 50s through current, and it all sounded great"
positive,subjective,"These headphones have adequate bass, treble, and mid range levels to accommodate all music"
positive,subjective,I played different genres of music and they sound great
positive ,objective,the sound is nice and bass is great for the price
positive,subjective,These headphones are excellent
positive,objective,i never had any beats headphones but this will save you a lot of money and i recommend it
positive ,subjective,I thought my other sony headphone was good
positive ,subjective,Well before you buy $250 headphones consider Sony
positive,subjective,When i got them i got them on and sound is amaizng
positive,subjective,Shipping was fast and i was excited
positive ,objective,Decent price and looked good so i order them
negative,objective,first i got Beats and i had them for 2 weeks and unfortunetly had to return them because sound got worst after like 3 days
positive ,subjective,I don't want to experience music through regular speakers anymore; I want everything to arrive at my ears via these headphones
positive,subjective,"I'm not a DJ so I can't speak to how well they'd work for swiveling on earpiece away while you're spinning, but I'd recommend these headphones to anyone looking for great sound at an affordable price point"
negative,objective,"I have started to notice very minimal creaking sounds as described in other reviews, but it's not noticeable enough to detract from the listening enjoyment"
positive,subjective,"They feel very comfortable on my head (and my head is by no means smaller than average), even after wearing them for more than an hour straight"
positive ,objective,"As for the look and feel, I have no complaints so far"
positive,objective,"I wanted to upgrade to a better sound, and these really did the trick"
positive,subjective,took them on the plane and was easily able to listen to my music without all the background noise:-)
positive,subjective,i love the noise cancellation as well
positive ,objective,"Cheap, great price and fast shipping"
positive,subjective,over all the headphones sound and feels great and very portable
negative,objective,but the thing i did notice while wearing them is if u move ur head a certain way the headphones make a noise
positive ,objective,"the wire on the headphones is pretty lengthy but not sure its enough for DJs, the headphones are comfy on my ears i used them for a few hours str8 and had no discomfort"
positive,subjective,they are very compact for easy traveling
positive ,objective,He said that the headphones are more comfortable than any he has tried
positive,objective,My grandson is studying to be a sound engineer and is composing his own music
positive ,objective,"I consider this headphones with excellent quality of sound, with good quality and flexible wire"
positive,objective,Even the guys with Beats Headphones can't bring themselves to justify paying over twice what I did for their Beats when these put out the same quality sound and bass
positive,objective,The best $78 I ever spent that's for sure
positive,objective,I watch movies with these and they sound like i'm in the theater w/the deep rumbling of airplane engines explosions etc
positive,subjective,expensive $399 dre beats probably dont sound any better than these
positive,subjective,Good design (I prefer a black cable than red)
positive ,objective,"These headphones are great, awesome quality and comfortable"
positive,objective,"00$ for them these actually sound better, paid only $56"
positive ,subjective,This is a good headset for home and outside it
positive,subjective,Highly suggest these to anyone looking for a sturdy pair of headphones with great sound
positive,objective,"I ride a bus to work every day with crap music playing rather loudly, and these drown it out"
positive ,objective,"Sound quality is great, and I don't even need them to be sound cancelling because of the way they conform to my head"
positive,subjective,"Also, I don't know why a lot of reviews are saying there is a creaking noise, I have not noticed any creaking at all"
positive,objective,Dre and cost a third of the price
negative,objective,They also leak a lot of sound which can be annoying
positive,subjective,"Cons: Noise isolation is horrible, I can heard everything going on around me"
positive,subjective,"Pros: Great highs, great lows, very clear &amp; powerful bass"
positive,subjective,The sound on these headphones is marvelous
positive,objective,For $60 these are a steal
positive ,subjective,"I bought these headphones about a month ago, and all I have to say is I love them"
positive ,subjective,I own a few pairs of headphones and these are the best
positive,subjective,They have great sound reproduction and Bass
positive,objective,"I use these every day, and often just walk with them around my neck when I'm not listening to anything and there's no &#34;creaking&#34; when I have no music on"
positive,objective,I brought them in with me to work one day and got a compliment from an audiophile co-worker of mine
negative,objective,"Unfortunately, that one costs an additional $45 for some reason"

positive ,subjective,I've had these headphones for a few months now and I've been very happy with them
positive,objective,"I also have a feeling it will last long, sony does not play with their technology"
positive,objective,I guess you have to study sound/audio performance and quality and be a professional to point out the differenece
positive,subjective,The sound quality is pretty much the same
positive ,objective,these headphones also feel amazing they are verry comfortable on the head

positive,objective,I put these on to check them out and the sound was incredible
negative,subjective,"I can't find the review that suggested PowerAmp and these headphones, but, man- I can't thank you enough"
positive,objective,"Passive noise cancelling, meaning they just drown everything else out when the music is loud enough"
negative,objective,"The only problem is leakage- its not terrible, but, I can't wear these in my library at school"
positive,objective,"Best of all is the sound, without question"
positive,objective,These handle everything from classical and jazz to hip hop and reggae
positive,subjective,"The ATH's are the only headsets that I have which give me that same liquid beautiful sound, like music is literally being poured over your eardrums- that's the best way I can describe it"
positive,objective,AudioTechnica ATH-50 BUTTERY smooth sound

positive ,subjective,Over all these headphones have been a shining star throughout my deployment and I'd recommend them to anyone
positive,subjective,Being new in the military it was recommended that I puchase good quality headphones for deployments and that's exactly what I got with these
positive,subjective,"They sound wonderful, bass is full and rich"
positive,objective,they're rugged and ready

positive,objective,Hint - Play with the equalizer settings on your I-pod as it makes a substantial difference in the sound characteristics
positive,subjective,The sound is excellent
positive,subjective,Grab if you can for hours of great sound
positive ,objective,I have had alot of different kinds of headphones but these are my favorites i had a different version of the mdr models and they cost more but broke easy so these i would definitely recommend and they are cheaper
positive ,objective,"All in All this is a pair of headphones that is GREAT quality for its price, both quality and sturdiness wise"
negative,objective,Also the cords not replaceable like other newer models so i have started to look for a second pair to use along side these with a microphone for calls
positive,objective,It may not have been the best sound for $100 but the sturdiness and reliability was defiantly worth the hundred
positive,subjective,"during the pregame and post game bus rides, and various other activities, i have thrown around stuffed into my backpack, jammed against the sides of the bus, and even dropped a fair amount of times, and yet the headphones still work and sound like new condition"
positive,objective,The trebles also sound muddied a tiny bit compared to higher price and higher quality headphones
positive,objective,The bass sounds a little weak at times but an equalizer on my phone fixed that quickly
positive ,objective,They are extremely sturdy and have nice sounds
positive ,subjective,"Love them, sony makes good headphones been ij the market for many years,"
positive,subjective,Sound like a surround sound with a sub for the price better than over price beats
positive,subjective,The sound is very good on my phone with beats audio
positive ,subjective,I really love those headphones they are awesome
positive ,objective,"good quality, adroit design and so on"
positive,objective,clean sound
positive,objective,"Most important is how strong and clear that the sound is when hooked up to either my iPod, PC, or home stereo"
positive,objective,"As for sound quality, it has strengthened base and three-dimensional sound effects"
positive,subjective,My budget for the headset is under 100 dollars and I found this one the perfect fit especially the fact that I got this at a discounted price
positive,subjective,"It's light, well-built and of excellent sound quality"
positive,subjective,"Good set,Great Quality,I would recommend this"
positive ,subjective,These also look great
positive,objective,"When I wear them and have them hooked up to my iPod in my pocket, there is still some cord slack hanging out of my pocket"
positive,objective,They can cause a little bit of ear pain after hours of use but that is to be expected with on ear headphones
positive,objective,"These things are durable, well built comfortable headphones"
positive,objective,The sound reproduction stays true to the way the producer intended it to sound
positive,subjective,It's sturdy with a comfortable fit with great sound quality with my iPhone
positive,objective,I have two sets of dj head phone from sony both are fantastic
positive ,subjective,These headphones are awesome
negative,subjective,I'm just using my experience to help you save a few bucks and still get fantastic sound
negative,subjective,I know several people who don't like almost any Sony's because they find them painful to wear for long periods
negative,objective,"Most electronic stores these days have them on display for you to test, so that should help out, but being comfortable is also a BIG deal"
negative,objective,"Honestly, I'd say these sound 95% AS good as Beats, and for 75% less money"
positive ,objective,"They're well manufactured, sound awesome and oh, did I mention they were affordable"
positive,objective,"Because the simple truth is this: for the money, these headphones just WORK"
positive,objective,I also decided to get a backup pair just in case
positive,subjective,"I'm just saying there are plenty of options that sound JUST as good, which will cost less--a LOT less"
negative,subjective,"If you have a boatload of money just waiting to be wasted on frivolous things, and have your heart set on Beats, by all means, go for it"
negative,objective,I'll put my more than 2 decades of professional broadcast experience on the line and say this: they sound really great--BUT--they simply are NOT worth their ridiculous price
positive,subjective,"They were fairly inexpensive (about $50), but I MUST admit, they sounded really great"
positive,subjective,"They felt cheap (because they were) but shockingly, they lasted nearly 2 years (about 18 months longer than I expected)"
positive,subjective,"I was impressed in that they sounded, well, they sounded okay if I had to be honest"
positive,objective,I nursed them to 12 years of use
positive,subjective,They were workhorse headphones which were built extraordinarily well
negative,subjective,"From the ridiculously cheap, to the stupidly expensive, and all points in between"

positive,subjective,The sound is clear with excellent Bass

positive,subjective,Movies sound great too
positive,subjective,The sound is clear with excellent base
positive,subjective,"To me the sound is better than all other headphones I have tried, even those $300 hyped up ones"
positive ,subjective,"my friend has a pair of pioneer headphones (dj style) and he said they cost somewhere around $180 (so he claimed, and they were nice more comforatable for sure) and sure enough i wanted to compare them to see how good of a bargain i had gotten"
positive,subjective,"i love these headphones, especially for the price"
positive,objective,And cheaper
positive,subjective,Use them every day and the price is great
positive ,subjective,The sound is amazing and they're very comfortable
positive,subjective,"They are load, good quality head phones my son really loves them they are durable well fitting easy to keep up with"

positive ,subjective,These headphones are amazing
positive,subjective,i would recomend to anyone who like music  or gaming they work well for that as well
positive,subjective,i went to the store to test out beats by dre and to my amazement these headphones sound better
positive ,objective,they are very tough and sound very good
negative,objective,The headphone pushes my ear back in a certain way and makes it hurt after about 45 minutes of use
positive,objective,I have been using them for about a couple weeks now and they are my choice for deep sound and bass response
positive,objective,These headphones have great sound compare to more expensive ones like the Beats
positive ,objective,Very easy to pack up and sound great
positive,subjective,This sounded great than I expected it to be
positive,subjective,the bass is also very good for the price you are paying
positive,subjective,These in my opinion sound better then my Beats Solo head Headphone
negative,objective,"The only issue that I have is that over the long time wear, the headphones become uncomfortable since I wear glasses"
positive,subjective,The contrasting in color is wonderful
positive,subjective,I've listened to several other units and I more than got my money's worth

positive,subjective,"The wire length might be a bit small for some, but it's perfect for me"
positive,objective,"The sound is clear, nice bass and the headphones are well built"
positive ,objective,Good quality for good price can't beat it
positive,subjective,Works perfectly good
positive ,objective,"Comfortable to wear, sound RoCkS, fits over her ears perfectly without any discomfort after wearing them for hours on end, and the longer cord makes it easier to move in them"
positive,subjective,"Anyway I think anyone would like these, just a matter of sound quality for the individual"
positive,subjective,"Completely &#34;over&#34; the ear (does not rest on it), seals good to block outside noise for the most part"
positive,subjective,The sound is good for me
positive ,subjective,"I don't know how loud other reviewer's have their music on but when we're in the car I don't hear his music, he loves them he says they're very comfortable and he can hear very well from them"
positive ,objective,"I bought these headphones for my 16-year-old son's birthday, he likes that DJ headphones look"
positive,subjective,He uses them to mow the lawn as well as on his commute on the train
positive ,subjective,Would purchase these same headphones again
positive ,objective,"Great style and sound quality, these do not dissappoint"

positive ,subjective,These have become my daily headphones at work
positive,subjective,For now these stay in one place because I beat up headphones with all my night club &amp; mobile gigs
positive,subjective,I like to hear all the frequencies &amp; the smallest details and these definitely do it
positive ,objective,"They have excellent sound quality, especially for the price"
positive ,subjective,These headphones are superb
positive ,subjective,the best headphone EVER
positive,subjective,They arrived on time and sound gpod
positive,subjective,The design is nice too the picture does no justice
positive,subjective,Work great and amazing for the price
positive,subjective,These have been the longest lasting headphones I have ever bought and they still sound the same as the first day I bought them
positive,objective,These also fold up for compact transportation
positive,objective,"The sound quality it great, something you would expect from Sony"
positive,subjective,"These work perfectly since they flip backwards, allowing you to hold only one side to your ear, without having to actually wear the headphones on your head"
positive,subjective,They pack a lot of punch and still leave you with money so you can afford to download music
positive,subjective,"Simple: I love it and the price it's amazing, Beats"
positive,subjective,Great price
positive,subjective,Item shipped and received as expected
positive,subjective,"Great sound, great feel, delivered on time and for a great price"
positive,subjective,There awsome sounds good
positive,subjective,Good for smaller heads
positive,objective,These sound clearer (less noise distortion) and have more dynamic range
positive,subjective,Great sound for the discounted price
positive,subjective,But the pictures are great and wevwere able to capture video of my daughter's First birthday
negative,subjective,just wish the small tripod was a big one
positive,subjective,Excellent professional quality camera 35X zoom is perfect includes necessary accessories recommended AAA +
positive,subjective,Great camera for the price
positive,subjective,"My daughter loves it, she said it was easy to use"
positive,subjective,So far really love the ease of use and all the features
positive,subjective,Was a very nice camera at a great price
positive,subjective,It takes wonderful sunset pictures
positive,subjective,We were able to get some amazing pictures
positive,subjective,"From 18 floors up, we could zoom in on things down on the beach with remarkable clarity"
positive,subjective,The zoom is incredible
positive,subjective,This is a great little camera for a great price
positive,subjective,Love the pictures I get with this camera
negative,objective,The top HQ setting is incredible and the way it handles low-light situations match other others far more expensive
positive,subjective,"You can set everything on auto, or if you know what you want, can manually control nearly everything"
positive,subjective,Great camera great pictures easy to use
positive,subjective,"Good Price, Good Product"
positive,subjective,Bought refurbished but looks and works like new
positive,subjective,Very happy with the product &amp; the speedy delivery
positive,subjective,Excellent for point and shoot camera for good photographers
positive,subjective,Perfect cost-benefit ratio
positive,subjective,"If you want a little bit of an upgrade, look at the NEX 6, offering a viewfinder and a hot shoe"
positive,subjective,The 5 in particular is the best price/performance compromise in the NEX line
positive,subjective,Size alone makes this a worthy choice over larger DSLR's
positive,subjective,"If you're coming from a smart phone, or a standard point and shoot, this camera will be a HUGE upgrade"
positive,objective,"All 3 of these problems are due to its small size, which alone makes up for it"
positive,objective,"These shortcomings are all pretty minor and expected in a camera of this class, so I do not hold them against it"
negative,objective,I recommend a spare battery for long days
negative,objective,"The AF system isn't quite up there with DSLR's, but its getting closer and closer each year"
positive,objective,"This is important because older lenses can be found for cheap on the used market, and gives the NEX one of the largest list of lenses to date"
positive,objective,"After market dealers have even created canon/Nikon mounts for the NEX, allowing the use of those lenses, minus the electronic functions (like autofocus)"
positive,objective,The Sony A mount adaptor offers all functionality of the alpha lenses on the small NEX
positive,subjective,This is a huge advantage because it allows for a wide range of adaptors to be made for the system
positive,objective,The NEX also has a very small distance between the lens mount and the sensor
positive,objective,"One mostly unknown fact is that lower megapixels tend to have better low light performance, and high 24+ mega pixel sensors are historically nosier due to pixel density"
positive,objective,"Sony's sensor has some of the best low light noise performance of any camera in its class, largely due to its 16 mega pixel count"
positive,subjective,It has extremely good dynamic range (most people call this better picture quality)
positive,objective,It has quick autofocus
positive,objective,"It has 10 FPS, faster than most canons/Nikons"
positive,objective,"Sony put a DSLR sized sensor in this tiny body, making for a potent but tiny camera"
positive,subjective,"Going from a NEX 5n, this may be a worth upgrade however"
positive,objective,Those looking to upgrade from a NEX 5r will find themselves with mostly the same camera
positive,objective,The new kit lens is a welcome edition
negative,objective,"The only real drawback is for those NFC equipped laptops, windows doesn't support large file transfer"
positive,subjective,"The NFC is really cool because for those with android phones equipped with NFC, it means quicker pairing between the two devices"
positive,subjective,It brings some cool and innovative features to the table
positive,objective,"This model, the NEX 5t, is another incremental upgrade for the NEX 5 series"
positive,objective,-High speed 10 FPS shooting for action/kids
positive,objective,-Some of the best low light capabilities thanks to the Exmor sensor and 16 megapixels
positive,objective,"-Small size, yet powerful ""big camera"" performance"
positive,subjective,I am thankful I found this system because NEX is the reason I am so into photography today
positive,subjective,GOOD IMAGE QUALITY
positive,objective,No cons as an extra camera with Full Frame DSLR camera
positive,subjective,Looking forward to buying the macro lens too
positive,subjective,Amazon has a great return policy
negative,subjective,I didnt  like that it didnt have a built in flash
positive,objective,and an application file where you can download programs to enhance you shootings
positive,objective,like using your phone as a remote control
negative,subjective,I didnt like the touch screen
negative,subjective,I didnt like the feel of the body
positive,subjective,"Price ok, great quality"
positive,subjective,No built-in flash but these NEX cameras take very good photos in low light conditions
positive,subjective,Even without a electronic viewfinder there is a setting that controls the brightness of the LCD screen which allows good visibility of the LCD on a sunny day
positive,subjective,I really like the touchscreen for quickly changing the focus location
positive,subjective,This is a compact camera that produces high quality photographs
positive,subjective,This is my first compact digital camera and I am glad I opted for this one and not the other Sony cameras
positive,subjective,So glad I didn't get something bulkier when the image quality (and video quality) on this is so good
positive,objective,Light enough I carried it around London and Paris for a week without a bookbag
positive,objective,"Gamechanger for me, stepping up from pocket shooters"
positive,subjective,"Great features, I love everything about it"
positive,subjective,Great for the price
positive,subjective,concept which works very well
positive,subjective,A somewhat unsurpassable design
positive,objective,Have only shot it a short time
positive,objective,will still accept the optical viewfinder for the 24mm equivalent lens which is what is always on the camera
positive,subjective,Just perfect (after one month and about 1000 shots in varied conditions)
positive,subjective,Excellent small package for great pictures
positive,subjective,A larger DSLR can be more ergonomically friendly
positive,objective,The flash is included with the camera
negative,objective,The flash is screw on and not internal
positive,objective,"For those that have previously used point and shoot camera, you might find that the multi tilt screen is more of a plus than the lack of viewfinder is a minus"
negative,objective,It doesn't have a viewfinder
positive,objective,You can buy an adapter that will let you auto focus with Sony Alpha and older Minolta lenses but the adapter costs as much or more than the cost of the 5T
positive,objective,Focus peaking outlines your in focus areas and makes manual focusing much easier
positive,objective,"To help you with the manual focusing, the 5T has a feature called ""Focus Peaking"""
positive,subjective,"On the other hand, you can buy cheap adapters that will let you use old legacy lenses that you can find quite inexpensively on Ebay"
negative,subjective,"In my opinion, the biggest negative is a lack of lens choices"
positive,objective,All that performance is packed into a package that will fit in a coat pocket or purse
positive,subjective,It fits in my pocketbook easily and is replacing a Panasonic LX-7 that I never really like all that much
positive,objective,This is an older model and it is being sold at a heavy discount
positive,objective,"It particular, it will focus much more seamlessly, if you do not use manual focusing"
positive,subjective,It takes better videos
positive,objective,You can add apps that perform specialized functions
positive,objective,"It also lets you take selfies, though the removable flash gets in the way"
positive,subjective,"This is great when you need to do over your head (for crowds) shots, lower shots, or macro shots"
positive,objective,It has a tilting screen that lets you see it at just about any angle
positive,objective,The latest Nikon has an optional device that you can connect for wireless
positive,objective,"The wireless feature also lets you use your smart phone as a remote, something that I probably will use in the future"
positive,objective,This will be important to many though not so much to me as I do usually want to use at least Lightroom to edit my pictures before I post
positive,objective,It is wireless - you can send pictures to your phone or computer
negative,objective,I'm not necessarily sold on the the touch screen but I do really like it for selecting focus points
positive,objective,Some may like the ergonomics of the larger DSLR with more buttons
positive,objective,It has a touch screen
positive,objective,Auto HDR lets you combine pictures to give your photo more dynamic range (detail in highlights and shadows)
positive,objective,The Hand Held Twilight mode lets you get low noise pictures at night without a tripod
positive,objective,They use the cameras fast shutter speed to take multiple pictures and combine those multiple pictures in camera
positive,objective,"It has useful scene modes like ""Hand Held Twilight"" and Auto HDR"
negative,objective,"Heck, I haven't even come across an advanced bridge camera that didn't have this feature"
negative,objective,All of the Nikon 3000 series cameras lack an auto Exposure bracketing feature
positive,objective,"The Nikon 3300, for example, won't even exposure bracket"
positive,objective,It has all the features that a mid-range DSLR has and then some
positive,subjective,"Granted the buffer fills up fast, but I generally want to catch that perfect action shot within a one second time frame"
positive,objective,It will snap off a blazing 10 frames per second
positive,objective,It has both phase detection and contrast detection auto-focus
positive,objective,It will focus faster
positive,objective,You will need to pixel peep to find any noticeable differences in image quality
positive,objective,16 pixels is plenty and produces more manageable file sizes
positive,objective,"That being said, the 5T will probably outperform them low light, though maybe not the newest Nikon"
positive,objective,This is an older Sony Nex and the newer C/N DSLRs do have more pixels
positive ,objective,"Not only that, it will fit in a coat pocket or purse"
positive,objective,Wifi to phone any picture easily
positive,subjective,Takes great pictures
positive,subjective,So easy to use
positive,subjective,"Overall, it does take some pretty amazing pics"
positive,objective,The flash is included by is required to be attached
positive,subjective,Great quality without having a huge camera with several moving parts
positive,subjective,Yes it work perfectly
positive,subjective,Otherwise they seem to be pretty identical as far as shooting goes
negative,objective,"The NEX-5n has a USB port for downloading but you can't charge the camera through it, you have to take the battery out and put it into a separate charger"
positive,objective,Connect it to your computer for picture download and leave it connected to top up the charge
positive,objective,"They give you a plug-in power adapter to use but you can actually plug it into any USB port, like your computer for example"
positive,objective,You charge this camera by connecting the whole camera to a USB cable
positive,subjective,This new one is more like the adjuster wheels on traditional film/DSLR cameras and is much easier to use accurately
positive,objective,Has an extra control wheel mounted on top for adjusting settings
positive,objective,Very nice upgrade over the NEX-5n that I have
positive,subjective,Very Good Price
positive ,subjective,light weight camera with incredible pics
positive,subjective,This is a versatile camera that is worth looking into if you want to travel light
negative,objective,"And this is me, I don't want bulky equipment for my light travel"
negative,objective,It is not a full frame camera so you can forget about it if you are looking for a professional production
positive,subjective,I would totally recommend it for someone who wants more than a point-and-shoot but not quite a dslr
positive,subjective,"This is small enough to carry around comfortably, and feels great in my hands"
positive,objective,"I thought that not having a viewfinder would be weird, but honestly it doesn't bother me at all"
negative,objective,"The menus and options are a bit overwhelming at first, but just read the manual"
positive,objective,"The flash seems somewhat of an afterthought, but this camera works well in low light without it"
positive ,objective,"It takes clear crisp pics even if the subjectiveect is moving or you don't give it time to focus, and I haven't yet had to use the flash"
positive,subjective,It takes awesome pictures as far as I can tell
positive,subjective,"Bought it after researching a few cameras, liked it due to its small size"
positive,subjective,I got it at a good price
negative,subjective,Sony really went cheap on the manufacturing of this camera
negative,subjective,Video quality grainy
negative,subjective,Zoom noise is loud when shooting video
negative,subjective,Feels cheaply made
negative,subjective,The LCD display is of poor quality
negative,objective,"The shutter is very slow, too slow for practical use"
positive,objective,"Even when trying to adjust manually the settings, performance still suffers"
positive,objective,The camera takes ok pictures when the conditions are optimal
negative,subjective,Pretty pitiful that you can't even take as solid pictures as a Sony from 10 years ago (that one takes 3
negative,subjective,Needless to say I'm returning it even though I'm past the 30 day window and probably won't get my full refund back
negative,subjective,"Yup, blurry picture and glare coming from the door of Sam's"
positive,subjective,"You point it at your kids, it takes a picture perfectly"
positive,subjective,"Picked out a new Nikon Coolpix S9100 that took excellent pictures in the store, brought that home, and it's PERFECT"
negative,subjective,but was still a bit on the blurry side and the colors weren't quite right
negative,subjective,What good is a camera if you have to be messing around with settings before each one
negative,subjective,"I would have used my DINOSAUR camera if I would have known that this brand new, almost $200 dollar camera COULD NOT TAKE BETTER PHOTOS"
negative,objective,Then I brought it to my new daughter's baptism and I got NOT ONE good picture because of the light coming through the windows
negative,subjective,"Some of the pictures were still blurry, but it was ACCEPTABLE, barely"
negative,objective,I changed the White Balance to get rid of the yellow tinge (FINALLY
negative,objective,So I did research and changed some settings on the camera so that the shutter speed and other settings were better
negative,subjective,"On top of it, since we have a large family, the pictures were consistently ruined by one kid or another moving and making a big blurry area"
negative,objective,"We have incandescent lighting and no matter how many ""auto"" settings I tried, I couldn't get the pictures to come out without them having a yellowish tint to them"
negative,objective,It weighed a ton and was a solid 1/2 cubic foot block of dead weight (or so it seemed)
negative,objective,"I received the ""Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-H70"" without: user's guide, manuals, battery charger, data cable, etc"
negative,objective,"AGAIN WE SENT IT IN WITH PICTURES SHOWING THE PROBLEM, AGAIN SONY CLAIMS THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA, IT MUST BE US NOT HOLDING THE CAMERA STEADY"
negative,objective,"THE CAMERA WAS RETURNED TO US , CLAIMING IT HAD BEEN REPAIRED WHICH IT HAD NOT"
negative,objective,"SENT IT IN FOR SERVICE, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, WE HAD TO PAY FOR SHIPPING"
negative,objective,WE PURCHASED THIS CAMERA AND IT  HAD PROBLEMS THE FIRST TIME WE USED IT
negative,subjective,NOT A GOOD CAMERA FOR EVEN THE SLIGHTEST ACTION PHOTO
negative,objective,"If you try to use the ""action"" mode then the flash doesn't work- so don't even bother trying to take an indoor photo"
negative,objective,Now I have a two yr old and he is constantly running and EVERY photo is blurry
negative,subjective,Other than it was really slow to take the next picture it was just okay
positive,subjective,Sony has much cheaper camera's that take better pictures than this one
negative,objective,It has gone down in price drastically since I purchased and I can see why
negative,subjective,It's not worth the money
negative,objective,"There are times that it takes a while for the lens to even come out when I go into zoom mode, almost as if the camera isn't recognizing it what it has to do"
negative,subjective,"If you do not have the perfect lighting, you will not get a decent picture"
negative,objective,"I have pets, I cannot take pictures of them even with the Pet setting"
negative,objective,"Gee maybe that is why they come out blurry, natural lighting has changed in the minutes it has taken to take the 4 pictures"
negative,objective,There is a long lag time between shots
negative,subjective,The shutter speed is horrible
negative,objective,I can take 4 pictures on auto setting in a row and only 1 will come out decent
negative,objective,"If the person moves, then the pictures comes out blurry"
negative,objective,"After you take the picture, whoever is being photographed has to remain still while the camera processes the picture"
negative,objective,Color and pictures are distorted
negative,subjective,Trying to implement the FLASH is very complicated
negative,subjective,I must be doing something wrong because it does not take motion shots very well
negative,subjective,"I took it to  a Sony Center and they said the internal memory has a problem that I have to change it, and the memory is more expensive than teh camera"
negative,objective,otherwise back to Canon
negative,objective,We had it repaired which took
negative,objective,The user interface is not very intuitive and this is coming from someone who has been using DSLRs for about 10 years
negative,objective,When you download the picture to the computer it is slightly less overexposed by still WAYY too over exposed and with the diffusion lines
negative,objective,In the &#34;P&#34; or &#34;Auto&#34; modes it basically makes the image completely white atleast in the preview
negative,objective,In fact all of the images look the same no mater what setting under manual is used
negative,objective,When I set the camera to &#34;Manual&#34; and adjust the exposure to it's fastest and aperture to it's most closed it makes no difference
negative,objective,After a short period of time all of the images are now being over exposed and show odd diffusion lines in the image
negative,objective,"If the camera was plugged in a power outlet, a orange or yellow light came on by the power button, but nothing happened"
negative,objective,"When I got home, it just wouldn't turn on again"
positive,objective,First day I took nice pictures and shot nice videos
negative,objective,Either this camera was assembled wrong or there is something up with the water seals
negative,objective,"despite the fact that there isn't a single dent, not even a tiny superficial scratch on it"
negative,objective,I got the run around and was told it wasn't working because of blunt force trauma
negative,subjective,I didnt bother contacting Amazon for a replacement because it was past the 60 day mark when I finally returned home so I called SONY
negative,objective,My hand was 3 feet from the surface so depth wasn't the issue
negative,objective,I took FOUR photos in the water before it died
negative,objective,This thing is NOT waterproof
positive,objective,Lots of photos that all looked great
negative,objective,"The second day I used this camera, it died"
positive,subjective,I haven't taken a bad photo since getting it
positive ,subjective,"It had worked perfectly since then, the only reason I replaced it was for superficial reasons - the color had come off the lens"
negative,subjective,"Terrible ""waterproof"" camera"
negative,objective,I went to charge it later that day and there was water in both access doors and it no longer works
negative,subjective,At this price point I should be completely happy with the camera and I wasn't
negative,objective,You are able to shuffle through pictures pretty quickly but not much else can be done via touch
negative,objective,"When I tried to bypass the auto focus, the picture came out blurry"
negative,objective,I missed several moments due to the unit attempting to auto focus
negative,subjective,I had high hopes for this camera but found it to take too long to focus on the subject before it captures the picture
negative,objective,He must take a indepedent charger for the camera
negative,objective,I tried and found the camera body had some trouble with charge
negative,objective,"After I use it two hours, I found the battery couldn't be charged"
negative,objective,The image it capture has color bleed and only good at outdoor scene
negative,subjective,I don't think there is a good rugged or waterproof camera
negative,objective,"Original camera that was shipped would charge and it wouldn't charge, took it to the beach on Kaui and before my great nephew could use it the camera would turn on and off"
negative,subjective,Do not waste your money- such an expensive camera should function more than two days
negative,subjective,I Called customer service- they were absolutely awful
negative,subjective,Unfortunately i was unable to use the camera for the rest of my vacation
negative,objective,The Touch screen froze
negative,objective,This Camera broke on SECOND day of use
positive,subjective,"All in all, it gets the photos I want and takes them better than I could with my dSLR"
positive,objective,Confirmed that it is waterproof by swimming with it in a pool
positive,subjective,"Furthermore, this thing always fits well into my pocket and looks enough like a ""party camera"" to be great for getting shots at a club"
positive,objective,"The photos this thing has taken have blown me away, it has actually made me consider stopping my study of photography because the automatic settings on this thing take better photos than I can compose on my dSLR"
negative,objective,"EDIT: Camera is not waterproof, completely invalidating my previous review"
negative,subjective,"unfortunately, this was not enough and Sony will not honor my warranty"
negative,objective,"in detail, they claimed I damaged the battery door as it was not aligned correctly, I told them this is how it came"
negative,objective,"Took it back to the Sony store and they said I voided the warranty, for getting my waterproof camera, well, wet"
negative,objective,"My problem is the first time we took it in the water, and yes, I read the manual and instructions etc, after about 10 mins, it took on water and was damaged"
positive,objective,we purchased the orange and it felt a little cheap compared to the black one
positive,objective,"Build quality feels good, apparently the colored models are made of different material than the black"
negative,subjective,"battery life is soso, maybe 200 shots and you are done, mostly because of the nice large touchscreen"
positive,subjective,not to mention the Sony brand it looks very cool
negative,objective,Leaked on first trip snorkeling and corroded all connections
negative,objective,It was just used on a windy day on the beach and it has never worked again
negative,objective,It never was used underwater
negative,subjective,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product as it is very fragile and must be handled with the greatest amount of care in order to not be broke
negative,objective,They did say that they would replace the 95 day old camera for $130
negative,objective,"I went to use this ""new"" camera on vacation, I dropped the camera from a height of less than 2 feet (it states that it is shock proof from up to 5 feet) and it SHATTERED the lens"
negative,objective,the first time I used it I went to remove the camera from my back pocket by using the wristlet and the wristlet BROKE OFF of the camera
negative,objective,Tried all kinds of things trying to make it work but no such luck
positive,objective,"The camera was fine the day it arrived, I fully charged the battery and tried a few shots, everything in working order and ready for our vacation"
negative,objective,"First time I took this camera into the pool, it stopped working"
negative,subjective,"It leaks, it leaks, it leaks"
negative,subjective,And it leaks
negative,subjective,"And if it can't do that, it's a paperweight"
positive,subjective,"Bottom line, this camera is good at nothing else but shooting in and around water"
negative,objective,It's even more expensive when you sink $90 into a repair
negative,subjective,And it's not a cheap camera
negative,objective,"Now I have a repaired ""Tough"" camera that I have no confidence in"
negative,objective,"$90 later, it was fixed"
negative,objective,"The camera had gotten water in the battery compartment and they had to disassemble, dry out the parts, replace a couple of fried parts, and re-assemble"
negative,objective,So I brought it into my local camera repair shop (it was out of warranty at this point)
negative,objective,"After drying the camera out, and re-charging the battery--nothing"
negative,objective,"The camera powered up, but there was nothing on the LCD--couldn't take a photo or video"
negative,objective,"So I put the camera on a shelf for 3-4 weeks, and went back to shoot it"
negative,objective,And the battery SD card door doesn't inspire oceans of confidence in terms of feeling like there is a strong seal there
negative,objective,"The flimsy outer door can get sand trapped in it, and you run the risk of scratches if that happens"
negative,objective,"I didn't, for example, place it in my swim trunks and swim around in it"
positive,subjective,It is hands-down its best feature
positive ,objective,The video and the stabilization is terrific for so small a camera
positive,subjective,Pics look great on the back of the camera--much less so on your monitor at home
positive ,objective,"The LCD is bright, which is great considering that it's usually very bright outside in water"
positive,subjective,First shots were impressive
negative,objective,"Both of those get far better results, but neither can go underwater (without insanely expensive housings)"
positive,objective,Pool park photos
positive,subjective,Rainy shots
positive,subjective,"Well, I wanted to get the shots I could never get before"
positive,objective,The stereo video and compact size is what sold me on the camera ultimately
negative,objective,""" But review after review touted the camera's durability and performance"
negative,subjective,"It's smaller than those cameras, has more features and doesn't look ""Tough"
negative,objective,THE GREEN LIGHT WAS ON BUT MY SCREEN WAS BLANK
negative,objective,"AFTER A LONG DAY OF SNORKELING WENT BACK TO MY HOTEL, TRIED TO TURN MY CAMERA ON"
negative,objective,THE CAMERA LASTED ONE DAY
negative,subjective,"Lots of wasted money on this camera,  but to mention the heartache"
negative,objective,I cant connect it to my tv and wash the videos from the camera I try the hdmi cable but no results
negative,objective,"Sony said that there are not known issues of water damages, go figure about other reviews with the same issue here"
positive,subjective,That is how good companies die
negative,subjective,"They didn't help me and I need to pay for the repairs, FLAT fee 130USD or more if they find more damage once they have it on their repair department"
negative,objective,Their customer service says it is not
negative,objective,"They said its is Certified waterproof, their website says: Model Highlights: Certified waterproof, dustproof and shockproof"
positive,objective,They gave a discount to the company I work on
negative,objective,We let it dry out before trying to power it up and it still didn't work
negative,objective,The 1st time I took it into the water while on vacation it instantly shut off
negative,objective,"Well, let me be the 1st to tell you that it is NOT water proof"
negative,objective,It says it's &#34;Certified waterproof&#34;
negative,objective,I sent it in for repair and they said there was corrosion and would NOT fix or replace it
negative,objective,I bought this for a vacation and was able to use it ONE day
negative,objective,I just got off the phone and will wait for the envelope
negative,objective,I also had to actually talk to the rep for 30 min in order to convince him to agree to send me a pre-paid envelope
negative,objective,"I called up Sony for repair, but they wouldn't guarantee free repair as it could be &#34;physical damage&#34;"
negative,objective,She said she had returned the camera twice for repair for the same issue until the warranty ran out
negative,subjective,"As disappointed as I was, I didn't think it would be an issue with other people's cameras, as I had done lots of reading of reviews here on Amazon"
negative,objective,"A piece about 5mm long came off, leaving the adjacent portions loose"
negative,objective,"After merely 4 months, very little use, and extreme care with it, the plastic bezel/frame around the screen cracked without any known impact"
negative,objective,"The last time I contacted them they sent me the same exact response twice, but about a month apart"
negative,objective,The time Sony and I have spent on this camera and it's issues has FAR outweighed the cost of the camera and offering a refund
negative,objective,They refuse to compromise or realize how ridiculous this continues to be
negative,objective,Until today they hadn't even acknowledged the fact that I have asked for a refund about 4 times now
negative,objective,they just want me to continue to send the camera in for repair
negative,objective,They refuse to give me a refund
negative,objective,Sony customer service has not listened to or addressed many issues I have brought up
negative,objective,When I sent it in to be fixed it took about a month to get it back and it  still wasn't even returned until I contacted them inquiring about it
negative,objective,"The first time, Sony didn't even attempt to fix one of the issues I had requested"
negative,objective,I am about to send it back in to be fixed for the 3rd time
negative,subjective,"I've been a long fan and customer of Sony products, but this has definitely turned me off"
negative,subjective,"So, I'm out the price of the camera after two uses, including warranty shipping back to the Sony customer service center"
negative,objective,They could not seem to understand that the water and corrosion in the camera was because of a product defect
negative,objective,"I was told, again, that because there was corrosion in the camera, they would not honor the warranty"
negative,objective,"The third, who supposedly worked for the national customer service center, ended up telling me that she was going to transfer me to the tech center that had the unit in hand and were the ones that tested it"
negative,subjective,""" To me, this is completely illogical and unfair"
negative,objective,"Their explanation was that it was ""uneconomical to fix the camera, so the warranty was void"
negative,objective,"After I sent it into Sony, their customer service center informed that it was not covered by warranty due to corrosion in the camera"
negative,objective,"Again, prior to immersion, I had checked the seals and ensured that the openings had positively latched"
negative,objective,"Even though I was not near the maximum depth for the camera, some water got into the camera and it stopped working"
negative,objective,"When I used it in the pool the second time, the seal somehow failed and allowed a little water into the camera"
negative,objective,"I only used it twice, and always made sure the camera seals were completely clean before immersion"
negative,objective,its the 3rd model I get that brakes due to water damage
negative,objective,Sony started making HORRIBLE waterproof cameras
negative,subjective,I'm saying buyer beware (and read above if you want to fight the warranty
negative,objective,And the fact I had to fight for a company the size of Sony to stand behind its name and warranty
negative,objective,For starters it is now just a point and shoot camera as we are too afraid to take it in the water if the last one failed and we did everything right (and the fact that it tested functionally waterproof at the factory)
negative,objective,They stopped shipment of the brick and sent a new camera
negative,subjective,"To our surprise, someone listened and decided to stand behind their warranty"
negative,subjective,You mean you aren't standing behind your warranty and name and blaming the little guy who just wants to snap cute pics of his daughter underwater
negative,objective,So after multiple calls they refuse to fix it and tell me they are sending my brick back
negative,objective,"Yet, it was USER error that caused the corrosion"
negative,objective,"Let me back up, in addition to following their procedures to ensure it was certified waterproof, I held my finger over the battery flap to ensure it did not move"
negative,objective,the seal FAILED&#34; Sony responded back to me stating they did their vacuum test and it worked
negative,objective,They approved the RMA but when it arrived at the factory they DENIED the warranty request stating there was water in the battery compartment and corrosion was present
negative,objective,I let it sit for a month or so before calling in to claim the warranty
negative,objective,"Low and behold, 101 pictures later I have a brick"
positive,subjective,That is customer service you can PRAISE
positive,objective,Amazon allowed me to return this camera for a full refund
negative,objective,There is light at the end of the tunnel
negative,objective,It's a waterproof camera that's not warrantied if water enters the case and corrosion begins
negative,objective,"The service center stated that they would not repair the camera, due to the cost being $700, nor would they replace the camera due to the corrosion which voided the warranty"
negative,objective,I sent the camera to Sony for warranty/Service
negative,subjective,I LOVED this camera until it quit after 6 months of use
negative,objective,Now it won't even turn on and I will be forced to have a picture-less vacation
negative,objective,However right now I am on vacation in Barbados and I went to the beach and the camera stopped working after being in the water for two mins
positive,subjective,It took good pics
negative,objective,"I called Sony customer support and waited for 30 minutes, eventually hanging up without an answer"
negative,subjective,"I used the unit properly and it has failed to work and expected Sony to repair or replace the device, but instead they want to get more money from me for a product that was defective"
negative,objective,"Essentially, I would be paying $400 for a new unit, because of a product manufacturer defect"
negative,objective,"the lens and circuit board is corroded and beyond repair, offered a replacement to the newer model for $200"
negative,objective,"I received a call from a Sony representative on 12/17/13 who stated the waterproof camera is damaged due to &#34;water or moisture&#34;, i"
negative,objective,I returned the item to Sony in November (one year warranty)
negative,subjective,"After drying it and several more attempts at recharging the battery, I hoped it would work again, but the attempts were futile"
negative,objective,It's basically nonfunctional
negative,objective,"Since then, it won't turn on and the battery won't recharge"
negative,objective,I never dropped it; I only used it in 1 foot of water in a pool (it is supposed to work up to 16 feet of water)
negative,objective,"com, I purchased the waterproof camera (Sony DSC-TX20&#8203;)&#8203; in February 20, 2013 for $199 + tax as a birthday present for myself for a friend's destination wedding in Hawaii and used it once in April 2013, then it suddenly stopped working"
negative,objective,"Thumbs down to Sony Tx10 (water damage), TX20 (2x cracked without dropping)"
negative,objective,Sony refused to repair due to warranty period
negative,objective,Within 3 months the case was cracked in the same spot without dropping it
negative,objective,"Camera sent in to Sony for repair due to cracked case, without dropping it"
negative,subjective,I now have it as a display in my beach front shop so the tourists know what NOT to buy
negative,subjective,"This was a big purchase for me, and planned on getting much use from this since I live on a Caribbean island so I treated it with extra special care but it didn't matter"
negative,objective,Accused me of mishandling the camera when I followed the instructions
negative,objective,The camera Malfunctioned from a manufacturers defect within the first week and Sony would not honor my warranty
positive,subjective,"Have to admit, I loved the camera the first two times I used it for snorkeling"
negative,subjective,"I see that many other reviewers had the same issue, and Sony won't even consider that the design and material have a problem"
negative,objective,The 2nd and 3rd time they told me that the warranty didn't cover unintentional physical damage
negative,subjective,"I didn't had the chance to test it underwater, since the 1st cracked appeared only 2 months after I got the camera"
negative,objective,"They claim that the camera is shockproof, but what is the point of being shockproof if it cracks without ever being dropped"
negative,subjective,Very disappointed with Sony's lack of customer service
negative,subjective,I don't want to use my camera underwater anymore because of the missing piece of the frame I feel it would ruin the camera
negative,objective,I told them that I felt that I wasn't in the wrong after the same thing happened to 2 different cameras and with me using the padded carrying case for it
negative,subjective,"They called me and told me that it was structural damage and they would not cover it, but they would send me a new model for $200"
negative,objective,to ship UPS
negative,objective,"I recently contacted SONY before the warranty was up and they told me to send it in for review for repair, which cost me $14"
negative,subjective,The reason why I gave it one star is because on the back side of the camera at the bottom of the touch screen by where your battery and SD card go there is nothing but a thin piece of plastic on that part of the frame
positive,subjective,It also took very amazing videos
positive,subjective,I loved my camera it took amazing great pictures both on land and in the water
negative,objective,It becomes corroded inside and it isn't covered by the warranty
negative,objective,It leaks
negative,objective,I received a call that the problem was corrosion and that was not covered under the warranty
negative,objective,It was only about 6 months old and still covered under warranty
negative,objective,There was no damage or anything out of place on the camera
negative,objective,It never worked after that
negative,objective,"The second time I used it (third overall), I started getting streaks on the image on the screen"
negative,objective,This malfunction left me without a camera on one of my most memorable trips
negative,objective,"I purchased this to go on my once in a lifetime honeymoon to Bora Bora and on the first day, first dip in water, less than 2 feet down the screen went blank and it never came back on"
negative,objective,They should have just repaired it or replaced it because it was still under warranty
negative,subjective,"As to the repair cost, why would anyone do that, when you can buy another camera for $200 less than the repair costs"
negative,subjective,I think that they just don't want to honor the warranty because it is almost over
negative,objective,There certainly wasn't any physical damage when I shipped it
negative,objective,"Well, long story short, Sony told me the repair would cost me $435 and claims that there was physical damage, which voided the warranty"
negative,objective,They had me send it in and told me it should be covered under the warranty since it was less than 12 months old
negative,objective,"When that wasn't the problem, I contacted Sony Repair"
negative,objective,It worked for 1 day on the trip and then died
positive ,objective,"The versatility of going from video, to camera to underwater was amazing, and all for $235"
negative,objective,The second one also fell from less than 2 feet and cracked the battery door
negative,objective,It rendered the camera unusable underwater conditions
negative,objective,My first one fell from my lap while I was sitting down and cracked the casing on a corner
negative,objective,"Service technician could not answer any of my question, stated furthermore that &#34;I should have purchased an extended warranty&#34;  Really, pay more to enforce the quality of the camera or to ensure that your claims of being waterproof are accurate"
negative,objective,"This waterproof camera suffered from internal corrosion, apparently not covered by warranty as the corrosion was &#34;not caused by liquid&#34; and therefore the camera is still waterproof"
negative,objective,Never worked again
negative,objective,"Shortly after leaving the water, I turned the camera on to take a pic of the wife, and saw the screen blink"
negative,subjective,"The camera functioned great for almost a year, then it got wet"
negative,subjective,Also the AVHD format is cumbersome
negative,subjective,"after taking grainy, not-good photos"
negative,subjective,"The 2010 model worked great for a record breaking three years in our house, and then broke"
positive,subjective,Olympus has much better customer service on their waterproof cameras
negative,objective,The number on the website 866-357-6230 is staffed by a representative unfamiliar with claims and may hang up on you after you have waited about 30 minutes to speak with someone
negative,objective,"52 estimate to fix a leaking camera and claim that you, the user, exceeded the limits of the camera"
negative,objective,The &#34;repair&#34; facility in Laredo will provide a $441
negative,objective,As many have posted it will likely fail within the warranty period but Sony will not honor the warranty
negative,objective,I purchase this camera on october 2013 and in my second use it stop working
negative,subjective,I used to love Sony but now I'm going to Nikon - never Sony again - falsely advertised as durable
negative,subjective,Worst of all - Sony refused to replace the camera despite it still being under warrantee
negative,subjective,So I was very upset as I now couldn't take any photos during my whole trip
positive,objective,"I used it for 1 week in the Seychelles, taking underwater photos etc and it worked great"
negative,subjective,My gosh Sony you just killed your household name with this camera
negative,subjective,I've tried different settings and everything
negative,subjective,"Photos are either so blurry, dark or so bright"
negative,subjective,"I'm not going to bother with asking for a refund or repair because it will most likely cost more than half the cost of the thing to fix, which is not worth it to me; I'd rather have a good camera"
negative,objective,"I bought this as a replacement for my previous Sony Cybershot W50 dying, and it looks like I'll be going with either a Panasonic or a Canon shortly"
negative,subjective,"Doing this did not fix the problem, and after a bit of searching I'm discovering it's a fairly common problem for this camera to just flat-out die on you"
negative,objective,"Today, however, the lens extended and retracted four times before a message saying ""Please turn the camera off and on again"" came up"
negative,objective,"Finally, most damning of all, my DSC-W330 began having technical problems about a week ago; the lens would extend, then retract, then extend again when I turned it on, and then I could use the camera"
negative,subjective,"The automatic selection of what mode to shoot in was also a bit annoying at times, and I'd rather have that control to myself"
negative,objective,"At a macro level, the camera may focus on a plane 2 inches in front of the screen, and everything projecting forward or back from that plane is going to be out of focus"
negative,subjective,"Macro shots are pretty terrible, focusing on one plane in front of the camera (and thus throwing everything else out of focus)"
negative,subjective,Also hugely annoying is having to shut off the flash every time it is started
negative,objective,It has no external knob to dial in settings
negative,subjective,"My previous Sony was brilliant, but i should have canned this model when I noticed that there were no real adjustments that could be made"
negative,subjective,Landscapes were particularly terrible
negative,objective,"It took shots that were either too light or two dark every time, and when light AND dark were in the same scene, it handled it miserably"
negative,subjective,"My recommendation : Do not buy this camera, it is a waste of your $$"
negative,subjective,This was the first time i used Electronic Expo and i am planning not to order any item from them again
negative,objective,I will speak to their customer service manager tomorrow and see if they can take the camera back without charging the restocking fee
negative,objective,"I am planning to return it but the seller is charging me 20% restocking fee, so even i am not happy with the camera it will cost me $$ to return it"
negative,subjective,However i am highly disappointed with the quality of the camera and its pictures
negative,subjective,"The pictures were soft, lots of noise at high ISO and dark, not so great navigation"
positive,subjective,The samsung has taken amazing pictures
negative,subjective,I prefer my 5 year old kodak easy share 4 MP over this sony
negative,subjective,I didn't even bother wasting my time loading the pdf manual because I knew I'd be returning this camera
negative,objective,"The shutter was hard to only press halfway down, most of the time it just took out of focus pictures"
negative,subjective,The screen was so noisy/fuzzy
negative,subjective,I hate to think that I may be giving a gift that is damaged
negative,subjective,"Because it was ordered as a gift, and so wrapped, I have not opened it up to inspect it"
negative,subjective,There may very well be damage to the camera inside
negative,objective,"When received in a box with ""zero"" packaging material, all corners of the gift wrapped package was worn because it was allowed to bang around inside"
negative,subjective,"Outdoor pictures may turn out better, but I don't think there are any saving graces for this thing"
negative,objective,"We were taking indoor family pictures with and without flash from 7-15 feet away in decent lighting, so there are no excuses for pictures turning out as bad as they did"
negative,subjective,"I fully recommend avoiding this camera at all costs, and cannot believe how many good reviews this thing is getting"
negative,subjective,"In addition, the 'Easy' mode on this camera is completely worthless and constantly cranks ISO up too high to preserve any kind of detail"
negative,subjective,"The screen on this camera might be big, but it was of horrible quality as well"
negative,subjective,"Bad exposure and noisy, less detailed, and blurry pictures compared to the others"
negative,objective,"A family member received this camera for Christmas, and after taking pictures with 6 different cameras during the night everyone was baffled at how bad pictures from this camera turned out"
negative,subjective,WHO SHOOTS PEOPLE IN WIDE ANGLE
negative,subjective,My other huge issue is the fact that it's a wide angle lens
positive,objective,"The one nice thing about the camera is the way it lets you delete photos, where you can select multiple photos to delete instead of going through and deleting one by one"
negative,objective,That's after I deleted most of my photos leaving about 50 left on the card
negative,objective,"I could also take at least 2 hours worth of video (that's WITH those 500 photos) When I tried out this camera, (with the same 1GB card) I saw that I could only take 8 minutes worth of video"
negative,subjective,I do like the screen but that's about it
negative,subjective,The delay is horrible it can not take clear pictures in front of the christmas tree
negative,objective,We have used this for just one day
negative,subjective,(I liked to open up pictures on my computer with Windows Explorer; loading Sony's PMB software made that so difficult with this Sony purchase of less than one month that I wondered if it related to the DSC W330's dysfunction
negative,objective,"My prior Sony cyber-shot developed a shutter problem after 1-2 yrs of use; although the one prior to that worked and still is, I now would not recommend Sony to anyone"
negative,objective,)  Then camera flat out did not work
negative,subjective,(Doubt if I can ever retrieve those 6 shots for their intended use
negative,objective,These included fact that camera was not communicating with 4-GB card and that camera internal memory was full
negative,subjective,6 shots; then I started having problems
positive,subjective,On 12/29 hike in the GSMNP it seemed to work fine for
positive,subjective,It then worked fine on several indoor shots in my home
positive,subjective,Worked fine on one X-C ski venture in GSMNP and at Xmas eve at my son's in GA
negative,objective,"Expedited delivery was for 1-3 days, ordered on Dec 27 for New years eve"
negative,subjective,"Should have used UPS instead of the unreliable United States Post Office as they say it was delivered, but never was delivered to me"
positive,subjective,The display is good though
negative,objective,"We bought one for our son and his wife, and the same issues show up in their photos"
negative,objective,"Pictures come out dark, and due to the delay, often blurred"
negative,objective,"There's apparently no way to adjust for bright backgrounds, so beach and snow shots are not really possible"
negative,subjective,"Worst of all, there is a considerable delay between pushing the shutter button and the picture being taken, resulting in lots of lost shots"
negative,objective,"Unlike the prior model, it offers virtually no user control"
negative,subjective,so stay away from this junk
negative,objective,There's so many other good cameras on the market in the same price range with similar features
negative,objective,I never got to return it becuase it worked OK for the first year -- and then failed over the next 6-months
negative,objective,"Like many of the other 1-star ratings, I found that this camera is slow, unstable, unreliable, unadjustible, and takes terribly grainy, washed out, underwhelming photos with obvious filtering flaws"
negative,subjective,This camera is a big disappointment especially when it comes to indoor pictures
negative,subjective,"1 MP seems to be the only thing you're paying for, but what's the use of sharp image if you are not satisfied with colors and light"
negative,subjective,"It's terribly simplyfied, to the point where 14"
negative,subjective,If you are looking for a decent point and shoot this one should not be considered
negative,objective,When the lens is extended the whole thing slides around if you touch it
negative,objective,Every singly button is loose
negative,subjective,The buttons feel so cheap
negative,objective,The motor shakes the camera when the lens is zooming in or out and the zoom is so noisy for being such a small zoom
negative,objective,I turned on the camera and literally heard and felt every component in the camera turn on
negative,objective,"When I first put the battery into the camera, I noticed the plastic door to hold the battery in"
negative,objective,That did not work either
negative,subjective,"I was so desperate, I switched to the three shot burst"
negative,objective,I missed all five shots
negative,subjective,There is always a terrible delay from when you push the button and when the picture is taken
negative,objective,I have five kids and trying to capture any shot of them doing something is impossible
negative,subjective,"I am sorry I tried the Sony brand and will return to Olympus, Canon, or Nikon"
negative,objective,Sometimes when you press the button you hold it and hold it and hold it and it will FINALLY snap a picture
negative,subjective,"All of the 1 star reviews were correct - it takes horrible pictures, there is a serious delay between when you push the button to take a photo"
negative,subjective,"It is a really poor camera for the money, buy anything else"
negative,objective,I did not drop this camera nor did I do anything at all to warrant it to stop working
negative,objective,For no reason at all the LCD display stopped working and you only see fuzzy black lines
negative,objective,"I purchased this camera on August 7, 2010, and on July 4, 2011, it stopped working"
negative,subjective,The software is terrible and the features of the camera are pathetic
negative,subjective,Would have been better off with a cheap Kodak
negative,subjective,or this model itself a lemon
negative,subjective,this sony product to me failed
negative,objective,for no apparent reason it failed
negative,objective,No drops or any sort of slight damages done to the camera
negative,subjective,"As mentioned by many customers, Images are very fuzzy"
negative,objective,Regular outdoor shots left my subject looking soft and slightly out of focus with the surroundings almost completely washed out and over exposed
negative,objective,Even when sunlight was coming directly through the window and hitting the subject I was photographing the photos were grainy
negative,objective,With flash
negative,subjective,Not letting this bother me too much since this is hardly an SLR I took several shots with increased ISO
negative,objective,My low light shots without flash were all full of artifacts and very grainy
negative,subjective,I was hoping that with the new image stabilization that the W80 would make my shots more clear than before
negative,objective,"ALl of a sudden the camera is refusing to be turned on and is displaying  "" turn camera off and on again"" on the screen"
negative,subjective,"Don't waste your money on Sony Cybershot, don't be deceived by their good looks"
negative,objective,"And they still have the guts to say that the company doesn't refund money, talk to the retailer"
negative,subjective,But as far as Sony is concerned its certain that their cameras are poor both on hardware and software front
negative,subjective,It's only because I bought the cameras from these reputed stores that are good enough to return your money that I have the courage to buy another one from them
negative,objective,"I come home and start the camera, and lo, the very first screen that lets you set the Date/Time was showing the ""variable names"" instead of English Sentences, something like ""ID_STR_HOME_SET_CLOCK not"
negative,objective,Needless to less it didn't work because when the problem started the battery was charged fully anyway
negative,objective,"I called up Sony service and read their FAQs (they have this stupid suggestion of ""resetting the battery"" which is like taking out the battery, charge it fully and reinsert it) but to no avail"
negative,objective,"First time I bought from Amazon, it worked fine for a week and then the Lens cover won't open fully"
positive,subjective,The only +ve point about Cybershot cameras are that they are bit user friendly
negative,subjective,"I plan on buying another camera from another company, and feel the wait time is out of line with how other companies deal with faulty merchandise"
negative,objective,They estimate I will have my refund in 12 days
negative,objective,"A credit will not be issued for 48 hours after the camera is returned, and Sony will only pay for FedEx ground"
negative,objective,"Technical support has been outsourced overseas, and I had to spell very common words to the person I spoke with"
negative,objective,"Within a month and a half of the shipping date of the camera, the zoom stopped working"
negative,objective,"When the battery dies (and there is very little warning), the shudder remains open, exposing the camera lens to scratches"
positive,subjective,"For the most part, I was happy with the pictures it took, the ISO is a huge improvement over the last digital camera I owned"
negative,subjective,The convienence and form factor are not worth it if the image quality is terrible
negative,objective,"Most of the images came our red and grainy, many were blurry"
negative,subjective,"We were very dissapointed with the image quality, especially indoors where less light is available"
negative,subjective,I will probably replace it with a similarly featured Olympus or Cannon Model
negative,objective,"Many of the candid shots that would have been most memorable - on rides, at parades, during shows - have the worst clarity"
negative,subjective,You can only imagine the frustration of having 400 images from a Disney vacation of which only 100 are worth printing
negative,subjective,"In simple summary, I would not recommend this camera to anyone"
negative,objective,It took a long time to load and causes operating system errors with my IBM Laptop
negative,subjective,"I hate to sound overly critical of SONY, but I would also add that the software that came with the camera was quite cumbersome"
negative,objective,I have read and re-read the users manual and found that nothing seems to help
negative,subjective,"I was convinced that operator error was the main cause of our problems, but I have now passed the camera around at enough soccer games and basketball games to ensure this is not the case"
negative,objective,"When the light begins to dim - pictures get progressively more grainy, blurred, and frustrating"
negative,objective,"Even then, action shots are always blurred - even when employing the faster shutter speeds available via selectable pre-programmed exposure modes"
positive,objective,It works best outdoors when shooting with a lot of natural light
negative,subjective,I must agree with several other reviewers that this camera produces pictures that lack clarity and focus
negative,subjective,Also FEDEX promised to keep item until I could pick up at their facility and instead returned it to the sender
negative,objective,Product was not received because of sellers delivery mode without warning that the delivery required a signature
negative,subjective,"If your subject holds completely still and is in great light, I suppose the pictures would be okay"
negative,subjective,Nearly every single picture was blurry
negative,objective,I took maybe 150 pictures and none of them turned out at all
negative,objective,"kids moving around, taking some videos etc"
negative,subjective,"If some one tried this camera in low light settings, with"
negative,objective,while recording in video mode
negative,subjective,Cannot zoom
negative,objective,Sony model and said that all of them have the same problem
negative,subjective,The lousiest setting that you can every
negative,subjective,zoom once you start recording
negative,subjective,"If you ever want to take Videos using sony cameras, you cannot"
negative,objective,"The WORST picture Quality, Worst Image"
positive,subjective,Until now I've take around 100 photos and the camera works OK
negative,objective,"Then I check the photos' date I,  there were taken on December , I took some photos to see if the camera works OK and then clean the internal memory"
negative,objective,I put the battery charging but the battery already was full; Second  I set the battery in the camera and I realize that some photos were taken from a guy and a family
negative,objective,"When I open the Amazon package I realize that the Camera box was open, cause Sony seal were broken"
negative,objective,I am currently appealing this with the company and have spent hours on the phone
negative,objective,"even if it was, a camera at this price should not sustain such injuries so soon after such light use"
negative,objective,They claimed it was an impact injury
negative,objective,"On the web page I found what to do for the error message, but it did not work"
negative,objective,I had taken about 5 photos and had not done anything that may have harmed the camera
negative,objective,"After my second day using it, I got an error message"
positive,objective,"The camera came in Excellent condition, but in different color"
positive,objective,"I bought it 8 years ago, unfortunately battery died 2 years ago)"
negative,subjective,Overall quality of the pictures are not nearly as good as my ancient Canon G2 (3 or 4 MP
negative,objective,"Majority of the pictures were blurry and grainy, sometimes even in well-lighted settings"
negative,subjective,1 out of 3 pictures I took with this camera turned out reasonably good
negative,subjective,"I also find that sometimes you think you took a great picture as seen in the LCD but when you actually see it on your computer, its a total different story"
positive,objective,The only optimal setting I find is a very bright sunny day inside or outside and your subjectiveect is not moving around then you have great pictures
negative,subjective,0MP sony camera was this bad
negative,objective,Low light produce grainy pictures
negative,subjective,Motion produces Fuzzy or Ghost-like image
negative,subjective,"If you plan on taking pictures of small children or baby, THIS IS NOT THE CAMERA"
negative,objective,I went to a wedding and took pictures in the church as well as the reception and I couldn't even edit them to send them to anyone
negative,objective,"While it does take great daytime (daylight) pictures, the indoor (and nighttime) shots are terrible"
positive,subjective,"From the reviews I read, I thought this would be a nice upgrade camera for me"
negative,subjective,"and trust me there is no operator error, i owned many cameras and i know how to take a picture"
negative,subjective,The build quality is absolutely HORRIBLE
negative,subjective,I wish I had pictures available of the amount of dust I found inside once I decided to operate myself
negative,objective,Since then it's been relatively fine until about 2 weeks ago when the memory card/battery door broke off
negative,objective,When I got the camera back I cleaned it myself using a microfiber cloth and an eye glass repair kit since they wouldn't even do that
negative,objective,Still no luck and they wanted $135 to repair it
negative,objective,"They said they'd gladly take a look at it but they couldn't do anything such as exchange it for another one, or give me credit to buy a different model without looking at it first"
negative,objective,I then called again and explained that there must obviously be a defect as this is the second time within the first few months of owning the camera
negative,objective,I did so and they sent it out to get repaired
negative,objective,I carried the camera in my pocket every day for approximately one month and I was seeing dust
negative,objective,We were gone for 2 weeks and a week after we got back I started to notice Dust behind the glass over the rear LCD panel
positive,objective,"All my other 6 cameras are working fine, the oldest is a Nikon I bought in 1981"
negative,objective,I could not believe a camera should stop working in such a short time
negative,objective,I checked for repair - will cost over $100 by Sony
negative,objective,"For unknown reasons, after it was turned on, it would not allow any bottons to function"
negative,subjective,"To my disappointment, it suddenly stopped working a month ago"
negative,objective,I checked around the internet and this seems to be a common problem
negative,objective,They gave me an estimate of $97+ for them to repair
negative,objective,"I called Sony and they had me re-initialize, to no avail"
negative,objective,"Then one day the lens wouldn't open and it gave me the error message: ""Turn the power off and on again"""
positive,objective,"It takes wonderful pictures - travel, close-up, family, everything"
negative,subjective,Don't buy it unless you want to throw your money away
negative,objective,Sony will repair it for you for $91
negative,objective,"But back it goes to Sony for repair, since I'm now out of the return period"
negative,objective,"After one more call to Sony, they said they would have a technician call me, but so far, no one has called"
negative,objective,")  You can still hear the clicking even from outside the unit if you move it, even if it's not on, which confirms there's still some mechanical problem in there"
negative,subjective,"(I left the shoulder attached to the unit when I shipped it, and it was still attached to the camera in the exact same place, which makes me suspect the case wasn't even opened"
negative,subjective,The clicking problem persists and I'm not sure the camera case was even opened
positive,objective,"The total turnaround was a couple of weeks, but I had to pay the shipping to Sony"
positive,objective,"I sent the camera to Sony's service center in Laredo, Texas, and it came back from Sony in a nice brown box, professionally packaged"
negative,objective,"And then later, when the camera was released, the company played dumb, blamed its customers, and offered a ""performance improvement"" to pretend that it was doing them a favor"
negative,objective,"Any reasonable testing suite would have uncovered this defect before the units were shipped, so the only logical conclusion is that Sony knew of the defect but decided to ship it anyway"
negative,objective,"After calling Sony support, I learned that I had to send my brand new camera back to Sony, wait several business days for them to fix it and ship it back"
negative,objective,"There are a ton of videos on YouTube showing examples of the clicking and how easily it can be triggered, even from a slow horizontal sweep of a landscape"
negative,objective,"The only way to avoid the clicking sound is to record on a tripod; if you use it as a handheld at all, it will click"
negative,objective,"This is untrue, of course, as the clicking problem occurs if you move the camera at all during video recording"
negative,objective,"""  An artful way of basically saying it's the user's fault for not holding the camera still during video recording"
negative,objective,"Sony acknowledged the defect and issued a weasel-like statement on its website saying that the ""phenomenon"" only occurs ""if the camera undergoes sudden motion while recording; motion generally inconsistent with smooth video recording"
negative,objective,The problem was first discovered and acknowledged immediately after the unit first began shipping in September 2011
negative,subjective,"The defect does not affect the picture quality of still images or video, but it does make the video recording feature unusable as the clicking noise is very noticeable"
negative,subjective,"Seriously Sony, make those lazy developers that ""work"" for you fix it"
negative,subjective,"Just another reason developers suck, because they are lazy"
negative,objective,"So when you clean off all your video files, the numbering starts over again at 00000"
negative,subjective,You buy a $600 camera and the stupid developers can't even implement sequential file numbers for video files--only photos
negative,subjective,The clicking sound ruins this camera for me
negative,objective,Yes this sounds like a PRO but not when you only get about 10 shots before the buffer is full
negative,objective,This sounds temporary to me and as stated there is no guarantee it will fix the
negative,objective,Apparently the fix involves placing grease or something on the part to dampen the noise
negative,objective,Sony has offered a free update but even the info on their page states that
negative,objective,Its well documented that the 5n has a clicking sound during video recording caused by an internal part moving around
positive,objective,Camera gives you plenty of control
positive,objective,Manual Modes &gt;
positive,objective,"List of features is nice like Panoramo, HDR and other effects"
positive,objective,The 5n seems to be a little more particular about lighting though
positive,objective,JPegs from camera match the 7D IQ in most situations including high ISO
negative,subjective,I simply cannot risk missing my return option to only find out later that Sony does not fix the issue with this body
negative,objective,This puts me just 4 days of my return window with Amazon closing so I am forced to return the defective camera for refund
negative,objective,Two days later and I do not receive a phone call nor an email response
negative,objective,I get the email shortly after and respond with the links to the videos
negative,objective,I offer to provide links to two videos that exhibit the problem
negative,objective,I have to explain that the camera has already been sent in for that issue and that the problem is something else
negative,objective,The tech apparently is unaware of the issue as he immediately starts explaining that Sony has a Service Notice for the clicking
negative,objective,The person again states that the Tech is already set to call me
negative,subjective,I respond with information about lens used and what I have noticed as well as a link to a video that exhibits the problem
negative,objective,My revised rating and review is based off the poor experience with Sony Technical Support and the repair of the issue
negative,objective,Approximately 10 days later I had the body back in hand and while the clicking sound was resolved there was a new sound problem that was even worse
negative,objective,Immediately upon receiving my exhange I sent the body in for the click repair
negative,objective,"Without the lenses and any moving part, with the camera turning off, just shake the camera a bit and you can hear the clicking noise"
negative,objective,Everything is good except the annoying click noise in video mode
negative,objective,"Other than that, the pictures are simply amazing, especially in low light, and I feel very sad that I have to return it to Amazon (unless they exchange it for a non-defective unit, but I doubt that is positivesible)"
negative,objective,"I say ""infuriating"" because when paying $700 you don't expect to have to settle for a defective product"
negative,subjective,"If they have, then Amazon is not getting fresh shipments because the camera that I just received (on March 12th, 2012) and ordered on March 8th, 2012 (sold by Amazon), still has the infuriating clicking problem with the sound in videos"
negative,subjective,I was really excited to get this camera and thought that by now Sony would have fixed the issue
negative,objective,"(Already NEX-5N had some clikcing problems, which Sony offered replacements)"
negative,objective,"I dont want to Buy a used product with Full Price, $775(including tax)  and not ready to deal with other issues with the camera"
negative,objective,"Also, the LCD screen had finger prints"
negative,objective,"when i saw the camera, i didnt see any sony stickers to it(One for the APS-C sensor and other for the LCD screen), because when i looked for ""NEX-5N unboxing"" videos in youtube, i saw those sony stickers in the video"
negative,objective,"but when i opened the shipping box i was not happy because there was no sony seal (which will be there for new, unopened) Sony camera box"
negative,objective,"Immediately after unboxing, I recorded a movie and realized that the Click Bug was affecting my unit"
negative,subjective,It has failed me at critical times and therefore I use just as a back up because I am stuck with it
negative,objective,Its back to precision camera again after it got completely locked up day before yesterday
negative,objective,But the camera error message came back on while I was on vacation
negative,objective,"I have tried formatting and changing cards, batteries even removing and changing lenses and the problem keeps coming back"
negative,objective,At times it works without this problem for days and then suddenly at a critical time it it starts again
negative,objective,The screen turns blue and flashes 'camera error'
negative,objective,The camera has inconsistent problem of getting locked up when shooting
negative,objective,I have had NEX 5 for a year and half now and I thank myself for buying an extended warranty
positive,objective,Somebody told me that clicking sound issue while video recording is solved so that I bought this camera
negative,subjective,Don't know the Sony repair engineers assessed it as physically damaged
negative,objective,The camera does even have a single scratch on the body or the screen
negative,objective,86 for physical damage
negative,objective,"Within a day after the Sony Repair Center in Laredo received my camera, they left a voice mail on the phone that there is an estimate of $ 210"
negative,subjective,"Plus, I bought an extra battery that will do me no good with a Canon"
negative,objective,"The first time it happened, the power stayed on for three hours before the battery died"
negative,subjective,The battery is not weak or dead
negative,objective,"It happens intermittently, which is no consolation since I want it to work when I need it"
negative,objective,"When I turn it on, the power light comes on but nothing else works"
negative,subjective,"The camera takes excellent photos and videos, but mine started having problems after only eight weeks"
negative,objective,Reset the thing multiple times to no avail
positive,objective,Even worked great yesterday evening taking pics at a party
negative,objective,Allowing only one picture to be taken each time the camera was turned on
negative,objective,2MP are losing a huge amount of performance
negative,objective,The zoom with auto focus is amazing compared to the Sony
negative,subjective,Why wouldn't I want the full manual from the start
negative,objective,"If you call customer support (which you probably will, it's 800-222-7669) they will offer to email you the FULL manual"
negative,objective,"The manual OR should I say ""manual"" it comes with is not a manual"
negative,objective,"Once you zoom in so far, it stops focusing and everything is blurry"
negative,subjective,Do you like auto focus when you take video and want to zoom in
negative,objective,to charge
negative,objective,The battery takes FOR
negative,subjective,The battery drains so fast
negative,objective,"You have to use iMovie or upload to your computer, purchase special software from Apple's site to convert files to view them in Quicktime"
negative,objective,You can't upload videos to iPhoto
negative,subjective,don't count on using the background defocus
negative,subjective,They are completely worthless
negative,subjective,I have foolishly purchased 2 over the last year and have not yet been able to download a picture
negative,objective,"1mp the pictures are fuzzy and lack clarity, colors look overly saturated and they can only be used for 4x3 prints, enlarge any further you'd be better off using an iPhone instead"
negative,objective,- takes at least 10 seconds to retrieve a photo and no instant viewing
negative,subjective,"I bought this camera because of the price and all these seemingly great specifications, this camera is really not worth the money"
positive,subjective,It has more features than the Sony's
positive,subjective,Menus look better
positive,subjective,"Buttons are flushed, which may irk some people, but I found that they are fine"
positive,objective,Canon 100 HS has a more beautiful finish throughout its surface
negative,objective,Higher megapixels generally means higher noise
positive,objective,55mm) to be exact
positive,objective,17mm x 4
positive,objective,"However, most point and shoot cameras such as these have tiny imaging sensor, 1/2"
positive,objective,"Canon 100 HS has ""only"" 12 megapixels while Sony W650 has 16 megapixels"
positive,objective,So I limit my price range to below $200
positive,objective,"For a point and shoot camera, the price only makes sense as long as it is below $200"
positive,objective,I went to a local brick and mortar store to get a better comparison between many different point and shoot cameras
negative,objective,It is a far cry from all other point and shoot cameras I have used in the past including Sony W50/W55
negative,objective,"for the flash, you can only choose either Auto or Off (at least on the intelligent Auto mode)"
negative,objective,The camera features are very basic
negative,subjective,"Going through the menu, I can tell that this is not a camera I would love to use"
negative,objective,The zoom is not smooth / even but rather jumpy
positive,subjective,The camera looks pretty in the pictures
positive,objective,It also has sweep panorama
positive,subjective,"Between these two, Sony W650 is newer and cheaper"
negative,subjective,"I could go on and on with my disappointment, waste of money"
negative,subjective,This is my 3rd sony Cyber shot camera and I must say I am very disappointed
negative,objective,Took two weeks for repairs and the camera still isn't working
negative,objective,when I received my camera it wasn't working and I had to ship it out paying for postage to have it repaired
negative,subjective,I stopped buying used thins
negative,objective,no function
negative,objective,and it did not work
negative,subjective,"I,m very ungry with this camera, because  it came broke"
negative,objective,"When I turned on the camera, the screen has several horizontal lines has permanent manufacturing defects"
negative,subjective,The photos are a really bad quality and they come out yellow
negative,objective,Doesn't look anything like the picture
negative,objective,F#$% OFF SONY
negative,objective,"They just dunk it and say it's still WATER-RESISTANT, so it must be user error"
negative,objective,They didn't do a user test underwater
negative,objective,I contacted all the way up to national customer support
negative,objective,They call and accused me of opening the camera door
negative,objective,"Called Sony, no apologies, no emergency loaner, just a send it in with the receipt so we can verify it's still under warranty"
negative,subjective,"OK, new trip, $5k trip with no pictures because the entire stupid camera craps out"
negative,objective,Got two new memory cards for the next trip
negative,objective,Called Sony and they blamed the memory
negative,objective,"OK, $10,000 trip with no pictures, because the camera corrupted the memory"
negative,objective,I bought this for snorkeling and it corrupted my memory card on the first trip
negative,subjective,Sony makes crap cameras and their support will accuse you of breaking it
negative,subjective,I hate to be mean but I would have saved $139 if someone had written this review six months ago
negative,subjective,The camera is so disappointing that I am tempted to put Sony down with HP on my don't buy anything ever list
negative,objective,"Perhaps I am being unreasonable, and a $100 camera is the digital equivalent of the paper box throw-away film camera, and it's not fair to expect anything in the way of image quality"
negative,objective,"5), so lots of images have needlessly blurred patches in the foreground or background (and you can't control that"
negative,objective,"In program auto mode, the camera has a strange bias toward fast shutter and low depth of field (such as 1/320 at 3"
negative,objective,Nearly every image has white burned in patches
negative,subjective,Contrast control is terrible
negative,objective,"The auto-focus gets especially confused by shiny, metal objects like bronze statues"
negative,objective,"The auto-focus (the only focus you get on this type of camera) is not very reliable, and quite a few images are poorly focused"
negative,subjective,The exposure metering is inconsistent
negative,objective,)  At 400 the images are already notably degraded
negative,objective,"The camera has ISO settings up to 3200, but at 800 the quality is already so bad you might as well not bother (unless it's something urgent to photograph and you don't care about quality"
negative,objective,"The camera says it has 5x optical zoom, but fully zoomed, the pictures looked like taken through a fog that wasn't there"
negative,objective,"Perhaps part of the problem is excessive or sloppy jpeg compression, but the camera seems to have no setting that would allow you to capture raw images even if you wanted to"
negative,subjective,"The camera has low-resolution settings, and I will try those in the future"
negative,objective,reduce 98%) and then sharpen in Photoshop
negative,objective,"You can get OK images for sharing on the web by resampling them down to about 300,000 pixels (i"
negative,subjective,"At full resolution, the images are so grainy and posterized that they are unusable for any purpose"
negative,objective,1 megapixels is a joke
negative,objective,"I shot a bunch of pictures on a trip in ""Program Auto"" mode (differs from ""Intelligent Auto"" mainly in that you can set the ISO)"
negative,objective,Can't download the pictures to tell you how they are because the camera is dead
negative,subjective,Why Sony doesn't just include an AC to USB adapter is beyond me
negative,objective,(Bought at Fry's) One charge I did from the AC charger went well but could not charge the camera from the USB while on my trip
negative,objective,"As noted in other reviews, the weak flash did not help here either"
negative,objective,Every photo was washed out
negative,objective,"When there were two subjects in the photo, the camera would focus on one and not the other, even if the depth was around 1 foot different"
negative,objective,"When there was even the slightest movement, the object would be smeared across the photo"
negative,objective,"By far, most of the images were blurry"
positive,subjective,It has a lot of features that seem pretty fancy
negative,objective,I have to pay $100 to repair this
negative,objective,Its spoiled on one week
negative,objective,I cant use this product even for one week
negative,subjective,Would not recommend and will probably have to get another camera to use
negative,objective,A lot of the pictures were very blurry and dark even thought we had it set on the automatic feature which is supposed to set the camera automatically for all the shots you take
negative,objective,The battery was fully charged so there is no reason it was dead after about 6 hours
negative,objective,The battery lost it's charged after about 6 hours and we were unable to take additional pictures that we wanted
negative,subjective,"I am so frustrated because so many people gave this camera good reviews, and it is simply junk"
negative,subjective,"It takes HORRIBLE indoor pictures, they are fuzzy over 90% of the time, unless your subject is PERFECTLY still"
negative,subjective,"I have tried using every function, and the picture quality is terrible"
negative,subjective,"I have given this camera over 6 months to win my vote, and it just is a waste of money"
negative,objective,"The battery cover doesn't stay closed well, the lock doesn't keep it closed"
negative,subjective,What a piece of crap from Sony
negative,subjective,Unsatisfactory for the money
negative,objective,"But screen failed in 15 months of very light, gentle use, making the camera unusable"
positive,objective,"Simple, adequate photos"
negative,objective,After 3 month of barely using it - suddenly stopped working
negative,objective,I bought a new card for it as it didn't come with one
negative,objective,It didn't work at all
negative,subjective,The seller of this cameral told me that it was new but wasn't in it's box and worked great so I got a good deal on it
negative,subjective,"I am disappointed as it was to replace my previous one that I loved, quit working"
negative,objective,"It has been returned to you, accepted and I have notice of my refund"
negative,objective,"Camera did not work, I did charge it fully before using"
negative,subjective,But the camera shuts down after a few minutes
positive,subjective,I mean video quality is also EXCELLENT
positive,subjective,"I LOVE the picture quality, speed, build, and everything"
negative,objective,"I'll investigate this more, and hopefully SONY will post a patch or something"
negative,objective,"When I try to take video, I get the message saying the camera is getting overheated, then it shuts down"
negative,objective,The on-camera flash mechanism looked and felt weak and looked likely to break
negative,objective,The documentation that came with the camera was woefully lacking in content and size
negative,objective,The camera was difficult to handle because it was so light and because it did not feel solid in the hand
negative,subjective,The two programmable knobs were unnecessary and useless
negative,subjective,Too light and insubstantial
negative,subjective,The camera felt cheap and tinny
negative,subjective,"If I did manage to take a picture, the quality was substandard, apparently due to the poor lens quality"
negative,objective,I put an o-ring over the video button which is in a bad place causing the users thumb to constantly touch the button and turn on the video
negative,objective,"By the time I got the video turned off, the shot I wanted to take was gone"
negative,subjective,The most annoying aspect of the camera was the useless video capability
positive,subjective,I thought the Sony might make a useful backup camera
positive,objective,$2 lens + $1000 camera = $2 pictures
negative,objective,"But the lenses that are available are very subpar, therefore the pics are the quality of a much lesser camera"
positive,subjective,If Sony made lenses the quality of the camera - maybe ok
positive,objective,Update: after re- reading my review there is one thing I would like to clarify
positive,subjective,My lens works perfectly with panorama mode
positive,objective,"It is not a Canon L, but is very well made and the shots are much, much better than the kit and that is what counts"
positive,objective,Also Tamron now has a fix for the panorama mode
negative,subjective,I was simply frustrated that I could not purchase what I considered a high quality lens for this camera
positive,objective,"I sold all my full frame stuff and huge lenses, just wanted a good camera that was small"
negative,objective,I just recently sold a Canon 5DMkII and some L Lenses to go smaller
negative,subjective,I thought I could live with the lack of lenses but the lenses available are just terrible in my opinion
positive,objective,One Zeiss lens is being made but unobtainable due to supply
negative,subjective,"Obviously, the performance will not improve by the recent price increase unless there are additional value-added features to justify the price increase, which they are none"
negative,objective,The sony NEX-7 camera has very good performance specifications but the recent price increase has moved the camera into the catagory of over-priced per specification and performance
negative,objective,"they are not fully UHS-I compliant, thus they can't take advantage of those super fast 95mbps sd card like the sandisk extreme pro"
negative,objective,another problem with all nex cameras is the write speed
negative,subjective,the only reason you would buy this camera over the nex-6 is because of the 24mp but i think the sensor size is too small for 24mp
negative,objective,"Regardless, stop buying their products that don't work or break soon thereafter and write to tell them that their products are sub-standard"
negative,subjective,Poor picture quality is at the top of the list (and is probably the most important feature of ANY camera)
negative,subjective,Not worth the price at all
negative,objective,"I had to use really high ISO rating to get right exposure, which inturn made pictures relly grainy"
negative,objective,Pictures taken Indoor and in Low light are especially poor
negative,objective,You can pay less for a DSLR and get better picture quality
negative,subjective,Don't expect picture quality of a DSLR
negative,objective,Lenses are limted and expensive
negative,objective,Instead they are charging customers
negative,objective,Sony should have really done a product recall
negative,objective,It is costing us $185 + shipping
negative,objective,They are not even covering it under manufacture warranty
negative,objective,Sony is not taking any responibility for the poor design
negative,objective,The HDMI connector came out after first use and stopped working
positive,objective,Product is built cheap
negative,subjective,However i quickly learned a lot about this camra that i wish wasn't the case
negative,objective,"They also sent me a European charger, and I live in North America"
negative,subjective,Very disappointed that I can't get my money back
negative,objective,"It would not save pictures, and would not allow picture review"
negative,subjective,5 weeks and zoom was not very good at all
negative,objective,Camera stopped working after 2
negative,objective,Someone who knows says that probably the LENS (included) is not  correct one
positive,objective,"2 and there is big, huge difference in the quality (color, detail) of the PICTURES"
negative,objective,"After messing with it several days, I broke it in the drive way and threw the scraps in the garbage"
negative,objective,"Problem was that its' software once loaded took over my desktop, but it would not allow me to move photos from camera to PC"
negative,objective,The screen only occsionally came on and stopped working after 2 weeks
negative,objective,I tried two different computers to no avail
negative,objective,"When we got home, I was completely unable to upload the pictures and videos"
negative,objective,I pulled the memory stick and re-inserted  it and was able to view the shots
negative,subjective,"If I wouldn't have been stuck out of town and busy just after I received this piece of crap, I would have shipped it back"
negative,objective,I called Sony and they couldn't give me any answers or suggestions
negative,objective,I tried changing all sorts of setting and it keeps doing it
negative,objective,"And under low lights, the camera is practically useless"
negative,objective,"Despite the fact that it's a 16MP camera, pictures come out with a lot of noise"
negative,subjective,Oh and the picture quality is just mediocre at best
negative,objective,"But there is no convincing them once they say there was ""physical damage"
negative,objective,"When I sent the unit to Sony for warranty repair, I was told that they had voided the warranty due to ""physical damage"" and are now requiring $70 in repair cost"
negative,objective,It just would not lock in place anymore
negative,objective,e it didnt move inside even when I shut the camera off
negative,objective,It won't even turn off
negative,objective,It tells me to turn it off and restart it but when I try to turn it off the lens will not go back in
negative,objective,The lens gets stuck every time I turn it on
negative,subjective,it's previous model was better and this one glitches and changes from one mode to another like it is possessed
negative,objective,the software or something is off on this camera
negative,objective,"Sony does not stand behind there warranty, and this camera is not well built"
negative,objective,They also wanted the same amount to repair the camera as it sold for
negative,objective,I sent it in to Sony for the warranty repair and they claimed the button had been physically damaged
negative,objective,I purchased this camera and the shutter button and zoom lever fell off of the camera while i was shooting a movie
negative,subjective,"DO NOT purchase this waterproof camera, there is zero warranty"
negative,objective,00 for a camera that isn't waterproof and has zero warranty
negative,objective,"So, sony wants me to pay 374"
negative,objective,How can you make a waterproof camera and not cover corrosion
negative,objective,I said it was due to a bad seal on the housing
negative,objective,"I said, yes, and that is why it failed"
negative,objective,I did notice condensation inside the battery compartment but not very much
negative,objective,The touchscreen stopped working so I put the camera away after pulling the battery and checking the hatches to ensure they were closed
positive,objective,One night the camera was acting funny when putting it in the ocean about a foot down on a monopod
positive,objective,There was zero corrosion on the housing after 7 months and the camera looked new still
positive,objective,"I rinsed and dried it after every use, I used screen protector, and was very careful"
positive,objective,After receiving my Sony I was impressed with the small size but was concerned on how it didn't seem a beefed up as my Olympus cameras were
negative,objective,"Sony told me it was fixable at first for $80 to fix  and said we will call you back to make your payment, getting my hopes up all day, I answer the phone later-on and sony told me theirs nothing we can do"
negative,objective,After 1 month camera got water into it and was announced by Sony as corrosion damage
negative,subjective,"If I have no luck with Sony on either getting a new camera or getting my money back, I will make sure to update my results with that as well"
negative,objective,But who purposely buys a waterproof camera to only use for 10 seconds at a time in the water
negative,objective,"and yes, I know you can do that on Photoshop, but it's about 500 times faster and easier when it's an option on the camera)"
negative,objective,- couldn't find a color swap option on here (my girlfriend loves using that feature just for fun and effects
positive,objective,"(and yes, I'm using the recommended Sony memory stick for this camera that others have bought)"
negative,objective,including zooming in on photos
negative,objective,except for it not being waterproof of course
negative,objective,"Overall, the camera actually should be a 4-star if it was waterproof, but considering that WRECKS the camera, it is getting 1 star"
negative,objective,"I have yet to call Sony to complain since I literally just got back from my trip, and I'm not looking forward to doing so seeing the other reviewer's responses about their attempts to get it exchanged"
negative,objective,"The camera is officially dead, never to work again for the rest of my 7 day trip that I specifically purchased this camera for"
negative,objective,"Then about 5 minutes in, having never gone even deeper than probably 5 feet, the camera start-up logo appears on the screen, flickers a few times, then vanishes"
positive,subjective,I love being in the water and now I finally own a waterproof camera to capture my memories in it
positive,objective,"Taking random pictures here and there, its working great and I think this is the coolest thing since sliced bread"
positive,subjective,"I am nervous of course, but hey, it's a waterproof camera"
positive,subjective,The pictures almost look too good sometimes - looks like they should be in a movie or something
negative,subjective,FOR HOLIDAY I WENT TO THE BEACH AND USED THE CAMERA I USED IT FOR A COUPLE MINUTES AND IT TURNED OFF I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BATTERY SO WHEN I REACH HOME I PUT IT TO CHARGE AND THE CAMERA BLOW UP
negative,subjective,SONY AND AMAZON ADVERTISE THIS ITEM AS WATERPROOF AND IT'S NOT TRUE
negative,objective,"I find this quite ridiculous and would strongly recommend not purchasing this if you plan to use it in water, or as in the case of my son who also purchased one, don't get it wet it is not covered"
negative,objective,"I had this happen once with an Olympus, and it was replaced under warranty"
negative,objective,The first time I used it in the water it lasted about 30 minutes and quit
positive,objective,Got the Sony because of the high pixel density
negative,objective,the camera useless and sony will not warranty it even thou it was purchased 63 days prior
negative,objective,the camera will not charge now
negative,objective,apparently one of the seals had leaked a drop of water and had slightly corroded the charge input
negative,objective,"after snorkeling about 5-6 times , the camera started shutting off without warning"
positive,subjective,"Great pictures/video, not waterproof, is now a pretty paper weight on my desk :("
negative,objective,"This is not waterproof, resistant maybe but not waterproof, do not submerge this camera"
negative,objective,"I got it in July 2011, 6 weeks later it ""couldn't withstand an impact"" (it fell in a national park) so pictures come out distorted"
negative,subjective,The WARRANTY is a DUD MIGHT AS WELL BUY A CHEAP ON-SALE CAMERA
negative,objective,"Now, after less than nine months from purchase I have sony case, batteries, memory stick cards and NO camera"
negative,objective,"Sent back to sony under 1 year warranty, but they voided the warranty, despite no visible damage to camera"
negative,subjective,"Disappointed right away with the lens cover function, which likely led to the actual lens crack"
positive,objective,I am now back to using my Olympus Tough-8020 it's a brick and heavy but at least it's Water Proof
negative,objective,"It is a good camera for land, but why pay the extra $150-$200 for the not so Water Proof feature"
negative,objective,and that's why all watches now are water resistant
negative,objective,"Just a thought, didn't watch companies get sued over the wording ""Water Proof"""
negative,objective,"Let me repeat that, they don't cover water damage on their Water Proof Camera"
negative,objective,Worst of all Sony will not cover water damage under their warranty
negative,objective,By the next day I could see the corrosion on the power plug and the camera was/is now DEAD
negative,objective,Unfortunately the damage was done
negative,objective,"I took the TX-10 twice into the water, no more than five feet deep -- when I came back to shore to review the pictures I took, the camera would not turn on"
negative,objective,The camera failed
negative,subjective,"For an International Company like Sony, this is disgraceful"
negative,subjective,This is THE WORST customer service experience I have ever had
negative,objective,"After patiently pleading my case for over 45 minutes, Brian refused the repair, refused to give me his employee number or manager's name or number, and then HUNG UP ON ME"
negative,objective,I phoned National Customer Service and reached the representative Brian
negative,objective,They referred me to National Customer Service
negative,objective,If the case had been assessed and confirmed as being covered under warranty then it is simply not acceptable to go back on that decision
negative,objective,How can I be told on one day that it will be repaired only to get a call 2 days later telling me it will not be repaired
negative,objective,"The camera was shipped back to me on 12/19/2011, unrepaired"
negative,objective,"The representative continued to deny that the repair would be covered, and REFUSED to let me speak to his manager, or give me his name"
negative,objective,"I explained to the Sony representative that this damage was not user inflicted, and should be covered under Sony's warranty"
negative,objective,I paid $399 for this camera new
negative,objective,How could the repair cost more than the actual unit brand new
negative,objective,"On December 18th 2011, another Sony representative called, this time saying the camera wasn't going to be repaired, due to the fact that the damage was user inflicted, and also due to the fact the repair would cost over $700"
negative,objective,"Anna, a Sony representative said the camera was being repaired and would be shipped back to me within a few days"
negative,objective,However I didn't receive a call from Sony until December 16th 2011
negative,objective,"According to Sony's records, the camera was received on December 3rd"
negative,objective,"I was concerned that having the chipped piece of frame would compromise the camera's water tight integrity, so on November 25th I opened up a repair case, work order number 300754213, and mailed the camera to Sony"
negative,objective,"While we were using it in November I went to put the camera in my pocket, and a piece of the frame came off on the side of my pocket"
negative,subjective,Unacceptable Sony Customer Service
negative,objective,"""5m waterproof"" is written on the front"
negative,objective,Took a 30min snorkeling at deepest 3m and this sorry-excuse-for-a-camera crunked
negative,objective,"There's not much to say, after all this should've been a WATERPROOF camera"
negative,subjective,There will be a design problem of this camera
negative,subjective,This makes the Sony DSC-TX10 one of the world's most expensive (and unreliable) disposable cameras
negative,subjective,The situation is made worse by Sony refusing to repair a camera that has been water damaged
negative,objective,The TX10 is beautifully designed and compact but Sony should be ashamed to claim that it is waterproof when it is simply not up to the job
negative,subjective,If you have any thoughts of using this camera underwater I would be sure to select another make such as Canon or Olympus
positive,objective,"I loved these cameras for their design and touch screed and didnt mind paying extra for it, but I am really DONE with them"
negative,subjective,YOUR CANT CALL THIS CAMERA WATERPROOF
negative,objective,"Used it for 5 minutes in the pool and put it down, when I came back there was a fog in the lense, flash and round glass sensor, woudnt turn on"
negative,objective,"TX5 lasted me a little over a year and TX10 I got 2 days ago, took it to pool party - it was broken within 10 minutes"
negative,objective,And don't get me started on their so called 'service'
negative,subjective,"This camera is underdesigned, oversold and not worth your money"
negative,objective,"Upon opening I found it had minute condensation spots on the battery (you had to look for them with a magnifying glass), as well as on the memory stick"
negative,objective,"The camera worked for a few minutes, then stopped"
negative,objective,Then I took pictures in the sea and the camera failed
positive,objective,"For example, I used it to take pictures in a warm pool in the South of France and everything was right"
negative,subjective,So it has gone from bad to worse
negative,objective,"So guess what, now SONY's stance is that since it was supposed Corrosion damage on a WATERPROOF camera they will not honor the warranty and it is Void"
negative,objective,"Again, I just wanted my old one repaired or replaced"
negative,objective,So They referred me to customer relations who offered 15% off new TX-20
negative,objective,I just wanted the same camera back working
positive,objective,"99 not including shipping, tax, and, the cost of shipping the new one"
negative,objective,So they refused to fix or replace it
negative,objective,"Corrosion from what, it never went near water and it was kept in a padded pouch when not in use"
negative,objective,Also that it was unrepairable due to corrosion damage
negative,objective,So I call tech support only to find out that they said they called which was not true
negative,objective,Contacted Sony and trouble shot and tech agreed that it needed to be sent in for repair at my expense
negative,objective,The problem started when the camera started shutting down than it would not power up at all
negative,objective,"This is my first and last Sony product, I will ever purchase"
positive,subjective,The stitching feature is pretty slick and works well
negative,objective,It is slow to respond and is difficult to program or set the flash
negative,subjective,"Unless this camera is defective ( I've read other complaints about fish bowl effect on other sites) I would give the HX5V a value of $200, not the  $350 camera that it's selling for"
negative,objective,"If it drops to the floor, it's not a case of  ""if it will break"",  it'll be a question of  ""how may pieces"" will it break into"
negative,objective,Flash level setting is not adjustable either
negative,subjective,Would have been miles ahead if you would have cut out the video option and keep the quality of accurate indoor pictures
negative,objective,"Come on Sony, new devices are suppose to improve from previous, don't add in extra features which are worse than 10 years ago"
negative,objective,"Have been considering the Canon G11 which really shines in closeups and macro, but that's not my life"
negative,objective,"But it was such a let down with the fish bowl effect, and the totally inaccurate indoor pictures"
negative,objective,"But if you're not shooting topics with any straight edge items in the picture, you'll be ok"
negative,objective,"Top and bottom lines are curved, no matter how it's zoomed"
negative,objective,"And as soon as you switch to video, it's like looking out of a fish bowl"
negative,objective,"That is especially  true with any florescent lighting, extremely tedious to try correct the color"
negative,objective,"Any indoor  ""moments"" that were taken, the totally inaccurate color makes the picture too ugly to share with others"
negative,objective,"By the time you take several pictures and make several changes to the setting after each picture, ""The Moment"" is never captured"
negative,objective,"For indoor pictures you have to keep playing with the settings get the colors somewhat close to being accurate, which defeats the purpose of a point and shoot"
negative,objective,"This is a point and shoot camera for ""Outdoor Only"""
negative,objective,"Sort of like what Toyota is did, got lost with their quality control"
negative,subjective,"I have been a hugh fan of Sony for decades, 90% of my electronics are Sony, but this camera is a HIGH dissapointment"
negative,objective,I'm returning this garbage and the one I bought for my brother; you couldn't pay me to add its putrid photos to my collection
negative,objective,All the fancy features are pointless if they are not actually taking pictures of what is there
negative,objective,"Looking through the LCD viewfinder, everything is washed out with a yellow tint, and that's how the pictures come out"
negative,objective,What is the point of a camera when the colors are not even close to reality
negative,objective,My ancient 5MP Kodak EasyShare CX7525 that I got for less than $100 takes MUCH better pictures
negative,subjective,The pictures have extremely exaggerated yellows
negative,objective,I miss being able to just crop my dogs face and see every hair and bump
negative,objective,When enlarge a picture I can see where the over processing really just smudges out the detail
negative,subjective,On my last camera the video was so bad I never bothered to use it
positive,subjective,With all that being said this is still an amazing camera which takes the best video I have ever seen from a compact camera
negative,subjective,"I really miss best shot as well, this camera is really lacking in the preset picture department"
negative,objective,I'm not used to having to wait like I do now between pictures
negative,objective,(edit I was able to run an extension cord and with some velcro got it some what user friendly)
negative,subjective,Maybe I was spoiled by my dock with my last camera but to have to take the battery out every time is just stupid
negative,objective,It is beyond me why they would not allow this to be charged while plugged in to USB
negative,subjective,And my biggest complaint is that I have to take the batter out to charge it
negative,subjective,The Really Flimsy battery door
negative,subjective,The Cheap Plastic body
positive,subjective,The panorama is a great way to get large rooms
positive,subjective,For that it works great
positive,objective,I upgraded from the Casio Z850 which was a great camera with incredible PQ
negative,subjective,I wasted my money don't waste yours
negative,subjective,"Grainy, Blurry, inaccurate colors, forget cropping, just crappy photos about sums it up"
positive,subjective,Every once in a while I get a good shot
negative,subjective,Any way the image quality is horrible most of the time
negative,subjective,Unfortunately I used this camera for a very important moment in my life and all the pictures came out horrible and worthless video in anything but full light
negative,subjective,The worst picture quality I have ever seen
negative,subjective,It simply produces some of the worst photos I have ever took
negative,subjective,"Even without being a total photo freak, this camera is awful"
negative,objective,Seriously a shame from a current top model (P&S;) from Sony
negative,objective,"The lens are also another big issue with this camera - out of each 10 photos, 3/4 had serious problems with distortion, etc"
negative,subjective,The picture is totally blurred and has no detail
negative,subjective,"I read a lot of reviews on this camera, but I really believe they fail to cover the most important issue - this camera produces really bad pictures"
negative,subjective,"However, on real world usage, the camera fails blatantly - mainly by the single most important issue: image quality"
positive,subjective,"Great features, awesome zoom, even HD at 1080i"
negative,objective,The features it boasts are mostly hype that don't prove out
negative,subjective,"At other times, the photos were fuzzy, as if the light was too low"
negative,objective,The Cyber-Shot photo was washed out as if the flash was too bright -- only there was no flash
negative,subjective,Close-ups were no better
negative,subjective,"An object shot twenty feet away was horizontally distorted, no matter the camera settings"
negative,subjective,Consumer Reports rated this camera quite highly but I found it produced flat-out awful photos
negative,objective,Sony won't honor the warranty -- even though I had bought it three weeks before
negative,objective,"In addition, while I was using this during a very hot, humid day at the Great Wall of China, sweat got inside, and the camera began to malfunction"
negative,objective,The original lens setting is so far out that when you zoom in the 10
negative,subjective,Terrible customer support
negative,subjective,Mediocre shots
negative,objective,"I am a tech person and this camera, which I rarely use, now has to be sent in again"
negative,subjective,"I called customer support, who were their usual brand of unfriendly and unhelpful"
negative,objective,I have been getting a new error for the last month
negative,subjective,"Okay, one more update"
negative,subjective,It's that their service stinks
negative,objective,"I tried to get to customer service, transferred three times, and they said they would repair in again"
negative,objective,I even tried to get them to take the camera back for a refund
negative,objective,They even first refused to pay for shipment of the camera to their repair center for the second time in six months
negative,objective,Sony tech support basically just tells you to call the repair center and that they can't help you
negative,objective,I use this camera about once a month and it breaks twice in six months
negative,objective,I called tech support and they said it was broken and to send it in again
negative,objective,Still a later update: I took it out today and it went down again
negative,objective,"Last call, they claimed they never received the camera"
negative,objective,"Then after days passed, I called back a few more times and got the same story"
negative,objective,"First few calls, their network was down and they asked me to wait"
negative,objective,"As pathetic as the camera was, I am now at 3 weeks waiting for my camera to be repaired for a job they said would take 10 days at most"
negative,objective,"Sure enough, it was a problem with the camera, not the memory card"
negative,objective,They just told me to go out and buy another memory card and a card reader and check it out
negative,objective,Sony customer support was no help
negative,objective,Say goodbye to pictures for the trip
negative,objective,"Five days in, I get a memory stick error"
negative,subjective,"Also, while it was working, the GPS was very slow to acquire, it might take 30 minutes or more if you move a far distance between pictures"
negative,subjective,"Warning, if you use this camera while it is hot and humid and somehow or another it gets a few drops of sweat on it, it may very well quit working and you will not get it repaired"
negative,objective,Sony is unwilling to back up their product(after the first rep agreed it should be repaired under warranty)
negative,objective,This rep said if there was moisture in it the warranty was voided
negative,objective,The repair center said the camera repair would cost more than it was worth and to call Sony back
negative,objective,"After sending it to Sony's repair contractor, I was told it had water damage and would not be repaired as it was no longer under warranty"
negative,objective,We were hiking the Great Wall of China with this camera and it quit working on the drive back to the hotel
negative,objective,"3 and NOPE, nada, cero improvements for its GPS or COMPASS in this camera"
negative,objective,Update:  Wrote to Sony support to see if a new firmware and software was in the works and never got a response
negative,objective,"For a geotagging camera it is supposed to be an outdoors camera so it should be water, dust and vibration resistant which is not"
negative,subjective,No bearing editing or display support
negative,subjective,The software is a piece of junk that only allows the user to se the geotagged photos in the world map
negative,objective,"The camera doesnt come with the high sensitivity GPS chip, the SIRF-III nor does it supports differential corrections: WAAS or NEMA, so accuracy is down to ?30 ft instead of ?6ft"
negative,objective,It doesnt displays the GPS coordinates where the user is located nor the Compass bearings where the user is aiming the camera neither in the screen nor in picture
negative,objective,It doesnt support any real GPS features other that geo tagging the pictures
negative,subjective,If you want to use the camera as a GPS or its Compass to navigate to any waypoint DONT buy it
negative,objective,But the movies that recorded many important events in our family and my kids' activities still can't play
negative,objective,"However, after I burnt the movies onto DVDs, they all became unreadable"
negative,objective,The PMC software couldn't find the video files when I inserted the USB into the computer
negative,objective,But the problem was that I couldn't import the movie into my PC
negative,objective,I bought this camera a few months ago and had to return it after having been struggling with the software comparability
positive,subjective,reasonable HD
negative,subjective,Poor camera quality from all aspects
negative,subjective,"Even on the highest settings, my cell phone takes better photos"
negative,subjective,I was shocked at the poor image quality of this camera
negative,subjective,Big disappointment for a company like SONY
negative,objective,I use my iphone to take picture instead
negative,subjective,WHO WILL DO THAT FOR YOU WHEN YOU ASK THEM TO TAKE A PICTURE AND WILL YOU STAND THERE EXPLAINING TO THEM HOW TO TAKE A PICTURE
negative,objective,People's faces are distorted in every photo
negative,objective,I bought a sony camera and every picture i take is distorted
negative,subjective,Certainly don't buy any extended warranty or anything because they will just fix it long enough for it to expire so they don't have to do anything about it
negative,objective,"""  They wouldn't even work with me on it"
negative,objective,"Then when I called them to ask if they would fix the same exact problem they said, ""sorry, your warranty has expired"
negative,objective,I turned it in under my warrenty to have it fixed and they fixed the problem long enough for my warranty to expire
negative,subjective,I had a Sony Camera that didn't work very well at all
negative,objective,THIS CAMERA SAW ONLY LIGHT NORMAL USE
negative,objective,00 TO REPAIR IT
negative,objective,I SENT IT IN FOR REPAIR SONY TOLD ME THE CAMERA CORRODED INSIDE AND THE WARRANTY IS VOIDED AND WANTED $450
negative,objective,I PURCHASED A SONY CAMERA AND IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER 8 MONTHS
negative,objective,I read up on it and apparently the HX5 is only available in Latin America and the GPS cannot work on the DSC-HX5
negative,objective,Sony doesn't tell you that you need a PC (not a Mac) in order to use the GPS feature
negative,subjective,"Resolution is very poor, colors are not natural"
positive,objective,I bought this camera last week and clicked couple of pics-indoors as well as outdoors
negative,objective,I bought the camera from amazon itself and only used it a few times and it got broken
negative,subjective,The images from this camera are awful to say the least
negative,subjective,"It was a good camera just that I wasn't happy about using memory stick and since then I started using Canon, which have been awesome"
negative,objective,"If you take picture of somebody, then better make sure that person in the middle of the picture, otherwise person may look odd, too long or too big head, or something like that"
negative,objective,not on memory card and not on camera
negative,objective,The pictures are taken and then some are lost
negative,objective,We have been having trouble with losing pictures
negative,subjective,"This Sony camera = Junk (Really, it should work in Hawaii, come on"
negative,objective,"""  Then I get one cryptic message about 'vapor damage' and the camera is back at the store waiting to be picked up"
negative,objective,"After 3 days, I turned it on, lens popped half way out, more messages, and now it's just dead"
negative,objective,So many error messages I thought it had a Windows operating system
negative,objective,"After awhile, the lens action was sticking, moisture on the inside, every photo was ruined, and then it got worse"
negative,objective,"Worked fine the first 3 months, then I took it to Kauai, Hawaii and it failed in the humidity"
negative,objective,A camera that is that flimsy as to die with a few drops of water that must of barely soaked through the case to raise humidity or
negative,objective,I removed the battery and let sit out for a few days at home and tried again but its dead
negative,objective,"I unzipped the case, the camera felt dry but when I tried to power it on, it was dead"
negative,subjective,While it takes very good pictures it is a fragile camera
negative,objective,"There was absolutely no damage or misuse of this item on my part, yet no matter how many batteries and chargers I purchased (in the hopes that was the issue, and not the camera itself), it still won't even turn on"
negative,objective,"I've used this item three times, and by the third usage (well after my return period), the device just gave up, and stoped working"
negative,objective,Best of all when I contacted Sony service they said that they will not honor the warranty because I didn't have a receipt
negative,objective,Now it will not download my vacation pictures
negative,objective,Then I started seeing an error message: E:66:11
negative,objective,I replaced the battery and it worked great until it failed to turn on
negative,objective,Whenever I wanted to use it the battery was dead
negative,objective,"Next step is to try to build a working frankencamera, or move on to a newer model"
negative,objective,"When I got the camera, it appeared to work fine, but after I used it more, I realized there was a lens error in the camera I received"
positive,subjective,I had this camera from when it originally came out and loved it until my kid got ahold of it
negative,subjective,"Roll the dice at your own risk (we did, because I ignored the bad reviews on this site and bought the camera anyway)"
negative,subjective,We ultimately had to dispute the charge with our credit card company
negative,objective,They are apparently a geographically disparate company that convolutes specific customer service resolution
negative,objective,"We obviously refused this, asking for a new replacement or a refund, which sent us through the worm holes of bureaucracy connecting Sony's awful customer support"
negative,objective,This is a relatively new model) and their only offer was to replace it with a refurbished camera (new for refurbished
negative,objective,The parts to repair were indefinitely back ordered (how is that possible
negative,objective,"After she opened the camera, it worked well (especially the wonderful HD movies), but subsequently broke on the second day"
negative,subjective,"I wanted GPS, and I didn't get it"
negative,objective,"The online guide offers more info, but how often can you refer to an online guide when you're traveling around taking photos"
negative,objective,"You have to rely on the camera's info screen for that, and not all of the icons are explained"
negative,objective,The paper manual doesn't even explain the icons that appear on the LCD
negative,subjective,Why not just print a step-by-step manual
negative,objective,"Even then, getting something done with the Menu system might not be possible"
negative,objective,"The owner's manual is extremely basic, so basic that it does not give you all the information you need"
negative,objective,"Unless you buy an extra battery and the $50 charger, you must plug in the camera to charge the battery"
negative,objective,"Between leaving the camera on during an entire outing, and powering the LCD and the GPS, you can kiss battery life goodbye"
negative,objective,"It can take well over ten minutes for it to get a GPS signal, which means you have to deactivate the Power Saver"
negative,objective,"If Sony wanted to include GPS with this camera, they should have made sure that it worked"
positive,objective,I bought this camera mainly because it has GPS
negative,objective,"I asked George (Sony employee number 25833) what that means, as it has never been in the water, or out in the rain, or left in the car and is stored in a padded case (not a scratch)"
negative,objective,Which apparently voided the warranty
negative,objective,"NO PROBLEM, I thought, it's still under warranty, but no, it has water damage, no it has humidity damage, no, maybe its heat"
negative,objective,"The digital controls stopped functioning, and while I could do some point and shoot (barely), I couldn't change any functions or review the photos"
positive,subjective,I was reasonably happy for 8 months (well within the warranty period)
negative,objective,"I called Sony customer service, I took it to a camera store and now I'm stuck paying full price in a retail physical store because of Amazon's carelessness"
negative,objective,I am now two days away from an international trip with a camera that never worked from the minute I opened the package
positive,subjective,"I assumed that the brand I trust, Amazon, would quality control any products going back out to consumers"
negative,objective,"The ""Intelligent"" modes need to go back to school and re-learn and become intelligent for real"
negative,objective,"Honestly, unless you plan on using the RAW mode or use manual modes to manually adjust every pic, this camera is not for you"
positive,subjective,"Oh yeah, if you want another positive, besides the camera's good construction, the flash is actually very strong"
negative,objective,"So the restrictions on ""scene"" modes is probably the deciding factor as to how Sony ruined the design of this camera"
negative,subjective,"That is completely stupid, as one can try scene modes with and w/o flash and ""override"" the factory setting for awesome pics"
negative,subjective,"The ""scene"" modes are frustrating, as most do not allow flash"
negative,objective,so I am limited to taking pictures between 11am and 1pm
negative,objective,"The only time a picture will come out ""perfect"" outdoors with this camera if when the sun is right above"
negative,objective,"Outdoor pics of the sun behind camera did not trigger flash, which is a huge nuisance, as my target was in partially in shadow"
negative,objective,"Overall, the Sony Cyber-shot HX9V has produced a barrage of terrible indoor pictures"
negative,objective,"I mean, the cat was either too dark, inside the room (regardless of ""mode"" or ""scene"") or he looked like a cartoon character cat, as he looks like Healthcliff (the orange cartoon cat from 80s and 90s cartoons, if you remember him)"
negative,objective,"Pictures of my orange cat (see attached to product) look absolutely horrible, as it seems like the orange cat ""tricks"" the camera's sensor into producing ""cartoon-like"" pictures of the cat"
negative,subjective,"Pics of me, being ?? Italian looked ok, a bit ""Eastern European"" ""grayish skin tone"", considering I am Caucasian white as well with bright eyes, so the skin tones were totally off"
positive,objective,"The ""soft skin"" mode actually produced some nice ""paintings"" of my wife, who is Caucasian with medium skin and light-colored eyes"
negative,subjective,"Regardless of whether the camera sat on a tripod or was carefully held (behind pop-up flash thing), the camera produced shots that were of horrible quality"
negative,subjective,The Cyber-shot HX9V has just been a disaster for me in terms of pic quality
positive,subjective,:( I will update several pics here so you can see what I mean
negative,objective,"As for picture quality, it turned out, almost every photograph was either too dark (indoors), extremely blurry, or had an orange or brown mix of lighting indoor"
negative,subjective,"Anyway, the flash is easily the most annoying physical feature on the camera"
positive,subjective,"I am used to, as most are, to place my right middle and index fingers on my left hand around the camera to keep it steady for perfect pics"
positive,subjective,"In any case, the camera looks good, feels solid, and had almost dream-features on paper for a compact camera"
positive,objective,"And the camera had a nice screen in a sharp LCD, the buttons and casing feel very solid, with a  rubberized grip on the right and solid/cool buttons all around"
positive,objective,The camera promised to create digital pics with a super 16x zoom in a compact body
negative,objective,"Anyway, after I received a damaged Lumix ZS20 thanks for Amz's un-padded paper envelope shipping (no kidding here), I purchased the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX9V 16"
negative,objective,For $211 Sony will fix a $279 camera
negative,objective,My pop up flash stopped popping up right after warranty expiration
negative,objective,The camera is less than 2 yrs old and stopped working
negative,objective,Ten minutes later the camera would not turn on
positive,objective,The camera was working fine
positive,subjective,The burst picture mode was great
negative,subjective,It is the most expensive point and shoot camera I have ever bought
negative,subjective,Not as cool features but an awesome zoom and it still works
negative,objective,The camera won't work without the flash
negative,objective,The flash stopped popping up within a matter of weeks
negative,objective,GPS never locked in
negative,subjective,Very slow reacting digital camera
negative,objective,"If you have a child you probably know how hard it is to capture a good positivee, but with this camera was really impositivesible because I couldn't capture the perfect light, or the perfect focus, and by the time I would finish modifying the camera settings the baby was gone"
negative,objective,"However every time I turn off the camera all my settings were gone, and then I had to modify the settings every single time I would take a photo because once you turn it off is doesn't save your settings"
negative,objective,"Another thing that really annoys me is that some of my photos were really bright, then I modified the setting, turned off the flash, and reduced the exposure levels"
negative,objective,I want to register the birthday of my baby but unfortunately I lost most of photos because the quality of the images and the same thing happened during our Christmas vacation
negative,objective,The ones that could have been great shots were actually all shaken with no focus at all
negative,objective,I'm not a photographer but I couldn't manage to have one single good photo out of this camera
negative,objective,and the camera charger is not even Mach
negative,subjective,"That's a shame on Sony, thought they would be more reputable company and honor their warranties and provide a better product"
negative,objective,"Still had a warranty, sent to Sony for repair, and they would not honor the warranty and tried to charge me $230 for repairs"
negative,objective,Suspect drop from high place causing internal damage
negative,objective,First camera was like new with package damage
negative,objective,Damage o second camera (cracked screen) was not listed in description
negative,objective,"Purchased through warehouse deals twice, both times there was damage"
negative,subjective,I decided too that the menu was not very easy to negotiate so I didn't order another of this model
negative,objective,"After resetting all features to factory default, it still wasn't correct"
negative,objective,The photos taken looked as if they were in a paint mode
negative,objective,"lengthy &#34;processing&#34; messages when taking photos (4-7 seconds), which stops you taking a following photos of an event"
positive,objective,Battery is fully charged
negative,objective,Makes starting sounds but lens will not move
negative,objective,"Will not open, keeps asking for the power to be turned off and on again"
negative,objective,"Stopped working on May 25 2014 (purchased on April 16, 2014)"
negative,objective,"It was shipped without the original box, no strap, and has hair/dust inside the lense"
positive,subjective,"With the brand Sony, it can do better"
negative,objective,I have never had any problems with a company fulfilling a warranty like this
negative,objective,I explained I have always kept it protected by a hard case and do not understand how I could of damaged the lens motor inside the camera
negative,objective,"scratches, dents, or damage) and they replied no"
negative,objective,I asked how I could have caused this issue; they could not give me a direct answer
negative,objective,An associate also stated the damage had been caused by me
negative,objective,Sony refuses to repair the camera due to it being too expensive so they gave me an option to pay $180
negative,objective,I bought Sony&#8217;s DSC-WX300 camera and after having it for 3 months the motor to the lens stopped working properly
negative,objective,However the controls on the back of the unit are a mess
positive,subjective,for a simple point and shot this a a great camera
positive,subjective,The picture quality of this unit is great
positive,objective,"Great Camera, great zoom for such a small unit, terrible controls"
negative,objective,They refused to use Warranty they sold with Ser# by questioning the purchase date
negative,subjective,Poor quality photos - vertical lines on many shots
negative,objective,beware that I have received 2 cameras with cable cords that do not fit
negative,objective,Was unable to charge
negative,objective,No charger included in box
negative,subjective,Save your money and buy something else
negative,objective,"Now, if I want to continue using it (or even retrieve my pictures) I'll need to BUY a charger"
negative,objective,"You need a special battery charger, which I don't have"
negative,objective,The AC adapter (the kind that charges every other camera I've owned) won't charge the batter on this camera
negative,objective,Now the battery has run out and I go to charge it
negative,objective,I had to buy 3 because I kept buying the wrong type and they didn't work with the camera
negative,objective,"First, it didn't come with a memory card and I had to buy one"
negative,objective,non worked
negative,subjective,ok i understand that it has been used and it will not be brand new
negative,subjective,Not wowrth the money
negative,subjective,really tiny
negative,subjective,Tiny
negative,objective,"Set up requested setting language, with an OK button on the screen, No amount of tapping and pressing, or pressing the center of the display button made it budge"
negative,objective,Dead on arrival
negative,subjective,"Yes, I am furious with Sony and its lack of customer service"
negative,subjective,"I can only do my small part by telling family, friends, and acquaintances about this outrageous forced extortion for more money for a shoddy product"
negative,subjective,They are ONLY interested in PROFIT for the company at the customer's EXPENSE
negative,subjective,Sony is completely uninterested in serving customers who buy their products
negative,subjective,So much for customer service from Sony
negative,subjective,It was a well used reconditioned camera with worn parts and scratches
negative,objective,The Cyber-Shot is not a $700
negative,subjective,"We do not have that kind of money, by choice, to spend on a camera"
negative,objective,I surely do not have a camera worth $700
negative,objective,My camera now is soaring in cost to the $700 mark
negative,objective,The person behind the desk said they do about 12-15 ships to Sony a week
negative,objective,I had to pay the $141 and the cost of shipping and insuring the camera
negative,objective,How could I throw away a camera that cost more than $500
negative,objective,In addition I sent a check for $141
negative,objective,I finally got information from the Sony site and filled out all the forms following the instructions to pay for insurance and shipping to a facility in Texas
negative,objective,No one could help and I was told that only a Sony repair facility could repair the camera
negative,objective,"In January of 2009 as I was about to take pictures, the camera showed a black screen with multicolored lines on the screen"
negative,subjective,I am furious with the customer service provided by Sony
negative,subjective,Took a few amazing pictures during trip but had to spend much time selecting settings
negative,subjective,Buttons/controls easy to hit and select wrong features
negative,objective,"Menu system different from other brands, not intuitive"
negative,objective,LCD flickering after 3 uses
negative,objective,4- W230 is cheaper than W290 about 40 dollars
negative,objective,"3- W230 take better pictures not as blur like W290, and I don't know why"
positive,objective,"Ok, I have tried out couple Canon PowerShot SD790IS 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and Canon PowerShot SD1200IS 10 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom, which I gave these 2 cameras 3 stars, then I went on and tried Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W230 12 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom and Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization, and I love this camera, pictures from this camera are very vivid and beautiful"
negative,subjective,The buttons are annoyingly tiny and uncomfortable to use
negative,objective,When those great shots come along--this camera would catch it in all of it's BLURRY glory
negative,objective,I would use it for 15 minutes and then have to take a break to find an outlet to charge it up so I wouldn't miss a great shot
negative,objective,Oh---AND good luck trying to take 20 shots without using up one bar of the battery
negative,objective,Not one is crystal clear out of 200 shots
negative,objective,I have to stand perfectly still and have my subject hold their breath to get a decent shot
negative,subjective,90% of my shots are either fuzzy or blurry no matter what I do
negative,objective,"well, they are as long as you can get a clear shot using this camera"
positive,subjective,"1 megapixels sounds great, right"
negative,objective,I didn't get the extended warranty
negative,objective,"Finally, I took it back to the Sony Store and the guy told me that the sensor went bad, and I'd have to mail in the camera for service"
negative,objective,I consulted with the user guide - which has a WEAK troubleshooting section
negative,objective,"However, when I turned on the camera last weekend, every picture I took was overexposed, no matter what setting it was on"
negative,objective,I'm very disappointed Sony decided to take this route because I have Sony digital cameras from 2004 that allowed you to zoom while recording so I do not understand why they took this huge step backward
positive,subjective,$60 cheaper and much better
negative,objective,My 7mp Kodak took much better pictures at a fraction of the price
negative,objective,But if you try snapping a picture of something that is moving all you get is a blur
negative,subjective,The truth is the picture quality is not that great
negative,subjective,i am a sony fan but this camera really makes me think twice about their products
negative,objective,you cannot watch a video you take with this camera - your eyes will go bad from the focusing issues
negative,objective,"while taking video and moving the camera around in good light conditions, the focus goes in and out"
negative,subjective,2) terrible video
negative,subjective,lighting conditions were really good and still the shots were blurry
negative,objective,i took some shots using a tripod and they came out fine but i've never had a problem w/blurry pictures when taking the shots by hand
negative,objective,"i dont have shaky hands at all and out of approximately 20 shots i took, only 1 was in focus"
negative,subjective,1) absolutely horrendous blurring in shots
negative,subjective,DO NOT BUY SONY CAMERAS UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY $300 FOR A DISPOSABLE CAMERA WITH ONLY 5 USES
negative,objective,The unhelpful technician told me my only recourse was to contact Sony and he gave me a 'direct number' for customer services
negative,objective,"But, I bought the camera NEW from Amazon and NEVER got it near water"
negative,objective,"Again, followed their instructions (inconvenient, at best)and was notified the warranty did NOT COVER the problem w/ the camera"
negative,objective,Spent an hour searching for warranty info on Sony's website
negative,objective,So After calling Sony's customer service (received only an outgoing message referring to website
negative,objective,"Again, no lights, no response, Nothing"
negative,objective,Used the wall charger to no avail
negative,objective,"Next time I went to use it, it had no charge"
positive,subjective,I purchased a Sony CyberShot camera and was satisfied with the performance
negative,subjective,We bought this less than 6 months ago and are so disappointed we're already looking for a new camera
negative,subjective,"Way too many of our pictures turn out blurry, colors aren't vivid, lighting issues aren't handled well by the software"
negative,subjective,It doesn't take good pictures
negative,objective,"Watch out for Sony's deep discounts on the DSC-W290, it's because relative to its predecessor the DSC-W300 &amp; some competitor's models, IT'S A LEMON"
negative,objective,The inability to zoom in/out during video recording doesn't sound THAT bad until you buy the thing anyway &amp; try using it
negative,objective,"(By the time the picture finally does get taken, whatever you were hoping to capture is probably already over"
negative,objective,Sometimes Sony puts out cameras that don't take pictures quickly or with good focus
positive,subjective,"As a positive, the video works great"
negative,objective,After trying all the settings on this camera I failed at getting useable indoor pictures
negative,objective,All indoor photos were so blurred they were unprintable in a 4x6 picture
negative,subjective,"This camera comes with a lot of features, but the picture quality was absolutely terrible"
positive,subjective,Excellent service from Amazon
positive,objective,I had a UPS person next morning to pickup the camera from me for return
negative,objective,They quickly authorized return of the camera without any questions even though I had missed the return window by couple of days
negative,objective,"After troubleshooting online, Sony asked us to send camera for repair"
negative,subjective,The pictures were not sharp at all
negative,objective,"I tried different settings - auto, manual"
positive,subjective,Small camera and pictures looked great on the camera LCD screen
positive,subjective,software is awesome
positive,subjective,picture quality is excellent as with all sony cams
negative,objective,Since day 1 the lens cover/shutter opens and closes slowly or not at all
negative,objective,I have had enough of this SONY junk after around 80 shots; it is going back
negative,objective,"In the same room, my ancient SAMASUNG Digimax S700 takes way sharper pictures than this SONY junk"
negative,objective,The pictures are soft and FUZZY
negative,objective,The colors are not correct
negative,subjective,"Seriously, those are simply the WORST pictures I have ever seen"
positive,subjective,Quick point and shoot
negative,subjective,Small and solid
negative,subjective,What a waste of money
negative,subjective,"Pictures are blurry, grainy, UGLY"
negative,objective,"Also, why give us a video feature without allowing us to zoom while filming"
negative,subjective,My 5 yr old Sony takes superior pics than this
negative,objective,"The first shot I took, in Easy mode with adequate light a steady hand and 3 feet from my son, came out blurry"
negative,objective,It also doesn't take what I thought was a standard memory card size
negative,objective,Pixelation occurs on almost all pictures on the LCD and when you upload it to your computer
negative,subjective,I bought this more expensive camera hoping its quality would be better then the canon I tried about a week or two before but it ends up actually being worse
negative,objective,"After 3 hours speaking to various people over the course of two weeks (so it was not just one random person, but seems to be policy), Sony insisted that they would not fix the camera, they basically said 'the camera has a problem and we don't fix anything for free without a proof of purchase, regardless of circumstances'"
negative,objective,But sony refused to fix it unless I paid for it or produced my proof of purchase to show it was still under warranty
negative,objective,"I sent a product in for a superficial fix (at sony's request as part of a recall), I got it back with the lens not working"
negative,subjective,Sony's customer service/relations is surprisingly terrible
negative,subjective,I won't buy anything from sony again
negative,objective,"a year later, we now have ANOTHER bit of dust in the lens, so another black spot in EVERY picture"
negative,objective,"We returned and sent the camera off to Sony to remove the dust, as the lens had to be opened up"
negative,subjective,"So imagine, going to Greece on your honeymoon, stunning views and landscapes with a big ugly blob in EVERY picture"
negative,objective,"On our honeymoon, a piece of dust got into the lens housing, causing a black fuzzy blob to be in every picture"
negative,objective,"the first time within a week, we found it defective as one day we turned it on and half the screen/view-finder was blank"
negative,objective,"Perhaps this is a lemon, but no one should have to pay $200 for a brick"
negative,objective,"While it took good pictures for the first 2 months of ownership, it began to fail horribly thereafter"
negative,objective,My old Cannon takes regular batteries and every time I have to reach for it this camera is ready to go
negative,objective,I do not take a lot of pictures so this is not a heavy use camera
negative,objective,They have been fully charged each time before I use them
negative,objective,Four batteries in less than two years is just not acceptable
negative,objective,Now none of the batteries will last more than a week in this unit and two only for a day
negative,objective,It did work a bit better for a short time after it was returned (it was gone for about 4 weeks)
negative,objective,Plus this camera has been sent in under warranty for this issue
negative,objective,I have purchased three new batteries in the less than 2 years I have had this unit
positive,objective,"Also, you may contact our dedicated Customer Relations Team and check for the available options"
negative,objective,The SSC will provide notification if the repair will not be warranted
negative,objective,IMPORTANT: Some repairs may not be warranted by the Sony Service Center (SSC)
positive,objective,"The warranty period for a product that has been repaired by a Sony Service Center (SSC) is 90 days for parts and 90 days for labor or the remainder of the factory warranty, whichever is longer"
negative,objective,"If the issue persists; unfortunately, service will be required, as the Camera is out of the warranty period"
negative,objective,"I'm sorry that the error message ""TURN THE POWER OFF AND ON AGAIN"" is displayed on the LCD screen of the Camera"
negative,objective,Evidently they don't think much of their repair department either
negative,objective,"We sent it into Sony to be repaired as instructed on 2 16 2011, the camera was repaired under warranty and returned to us Less than 8 months later the camera began having the same problem"
negative,objective,"The camera began malfunctioning before it was a year old, the lens opening partially and not allowing the camera to operate giving a message ""turn power off and on again"" each time the camera was turned on"
negative,objective,Can't zoom in during movie mode
negative,subjective,But picture quality sucks
positive,subjective,"Sony lcd quality is exceptional, better than most"
negative,objective,The Auto does not work well and takes pictures often when you need a flash
negative,objective,There is also no feature to turn the flash on
negative,objective,I try to get a shot of my 2 year old son and it does not work
negative,subjective,This is not your camera if you want to take a picture of anything slightly moving
negative,objective,This camera stopped working after six months
negative,subjective,Did not save pics to sd card
negative,objective,Did not work from beginning
negative,objective,On/Off Button had issue
negative,objective,So why should I need to pay extra 150 plus TAX
negative,objective,The battery pack was open
negative,objective,There is no coverage on the screen
negative,objective,But when I get the camera it has no safety band on its box
positive,objective,After paying tax the price difference between Best Buy and Amazon
positive,subjective,I cannot say a word but it s the best camera for its price
negative,objective,so I had to take all my pictures using my iPhone which not surprisingly struggled in low light indoor situations
negative,objective,&#34;cannot recognize lens&#34; error
negative,objective,"technically, the lens died"
negative,subjective,"Also, the zoom is disappointing"
negative,subjective,It's much bigger than expected
positive,objective,The main reason we bought it was to have a more portable camera
negative,objective,Didn't get prom or graduation pictures
negative,objective,Turn power off then on
negative,objective,"Then last week, the day of my daughter's prom, one week after the warrantee was up, the camera would not turn on"
negative,objective,Bumps are not covered by warrantee and we have since found many dozens of people that have had the same problem - the SELP1650 lens that comes with it is VERY FRAGILE and cannot take the slightest bumps
negative,objective,"8 months after purchase, the lens it a counter edge, and stopped working"
negative,subjective,"However, the biggest problem is construction"
negative,subjective,The quality of the images that we had from this have been poor
negative,subjective,I have NEVER had one of them fail ever- I have abused them repeatedly in harsh conditions in the mountains and at sea
negative,objective,Sony has a lot to learn from Apple about customer service
negative,subjective,I have found now that I cannot use my NEX that my  iPhone 5S works just as well in the situations where I do not want to lug around a DSLR
negative,subjective,The NEX is in the end a very expensive pocket camera
negative,objective,"I shoot a lot of action sports (surfing, skateboarding) and the NEX is just useless there"
negative,objective,Apparently this lens recognition error is widespread and Sony is unwilling to acknowledge it
negative,objective,"And, unlike every other decent manufacturer, Sony does not send you a prepaid shipping box to enable the return"
negative,objective,"He asked me to send the lens to their Laredo, Texas facility where he would not even give me an estimate of the cost of repair"
negative,objective,Sony's customer service rep was beyond clueless and of no help
negative,objective,"As suggested by others I have cleaned the contacts on the camera and the lens, fiddled with various internal camera settings, but nothing will get this disabling error to go away"
negative,subjective,"My negative review stems largely from the sudden appearance of the : &#34;cannot recognize lens, attach it properly error&#34;"
negative,objective,"&#34; After contacting Sony and performing all suggested fixes to no avail, the camera has to be sent in for repairs"
negative,objective,"Three weeks in, I received an error message &#34;Lens not recognized"
negative,subjective,"The camera is not very simple to use , and have a very slow response time before taking shots and after it while processing"
negative,subjective,Too complicated and cumbersome
negative,subjective,Still q or king on a way to fix it
negative,objective,The camera suddenly stoped recognising the small lens
negative,objective,"SONY Support is very hard to work with, Camera itself, using wireless function is impositivesible"
negative,objective,"Camera worked for LESS than 100 photos, LESS than 3 months"
negative,objective,In fact all the other demo units in the store were having similar screen issue
negative,subjective,My gripe was with the banding and constant flickering on the screen whenever i half pressed the shutter to focus
negative,subjective,Too expensive
negative,subjective,But I regret buying it with this price
negative,objective,battery/camera died after a week and I had to return for an exchange
negative,objective,My biggest problem with the camera is that it does not focus correctly
negative,objective,"I did this several times and have tried EVERYTHING to re-inserting, giving it time, trying to format it on my computer, trying to reformat it in the camera, using other camera's working memory cards, etc and still it tells me that &#34;Memory Card cannot be read - please insert memory card"
negative,objective,"Unfortunately, as soon as I turned the camera on the &#34;memory card&#34; was unable to be read and prompted me to re-insert it"
negative,objective,") They do NOT say how the user is supposed to know harmful condensation has occurred inside the camera body (not the lens), or how to avoid the problem recurring, nor do they provide anything really more than a vague warning"
negative,objective,(There are manufacturing techniques that would essentially eliminate this issue but would probably increase the camera price beyond a viable sale point
negative,objective,"Sony knows there is a potential problem with the camera because they briefly mention cold, heat and humidity in the user manual"
negative,objective,Note that moving from time spent in the cold into a hot environment would tend to cause condensation on the outside surface of a hollow object that had reached thermal equilibrium at the lower temperature
negative,objective,"As soon as it is working, it will be vulnerable to the exact same failure again"
negative,objective,""" An authorized Sony repair shop here in Thailand where I bought it has quoted $220 to repair the camera because it was ""broken by water"
negative,objective,My new RX-100 lasted two months in SE Asia and went completely dead
negative,objective,"Should you walk around outside in hot humid conditions, then step into an air-conditioned space like a restaurant or your hotel - or home - moisture is likely to condense inside the camera"
negative,objective,"I dont even think its got no rf gain or dynamike on it, there aint no antanna jack or pl-259 input, and there aint no fancy stuff enough for me, this aint no dslr, i think it looks goofy and for all yall who dont like my review too bad, man up and say somethin on here"
positive,subjective,This camera does make wonderful video and stills
negative,subjective,"I find the normal camera functions much too complicated, not very intuitive and if you just rely on automatic, you will often be disappointed"
negative,objective,"Basically useless unless you are going to take the trouble to illuminate the space you are videoing, which basically wipes out spontaneity"
negative,subjective,I thought it would replace by Flip Video cameras but does much worse in indoor settings with less light
negative,subjective,It is a very poor video camera
negative,objective,Spent over 2 hours on the phone with Sony Customer Relations and they would not replace or repair the camera
negative,objective,When I sent it into Sony I was told it had corrosion damage (even though it has never been exposed to water or high humidity)
negative,objective,The camera stopped working for no obvious reason
negative,subjective,Sony should cease production of this camera because it will hurt their reputation
negative,objective,"To sum up, I received poor value for my money"
negative,objective,"Then another person in customer service told me that it was damaged, all the way through to the LCD, and that they couldn't take it back"
negative,objective,Since my screen had a scratch I was told that there would be a 30% restocking fee
negative,objective,From what I could see it was no better than the aforementioned Nikon pocket camera that cost half as much years ago
negative,objective,"Lastly, regarding the quality of the photos, it does not even approach the quality of a Nikon D7000, which I happen to own"
negative,objective,I found it nearly impossible to see anything on the screen when I was outside in bright sunlight
negative,subjective,That proved not to be the case
negative,objective,Another thing was that it was promoted how the screen had some special qualities which made it easy to view what you are photographing when out in sunlight
negative,objective,"I even put it on Landscape mode to force the camera to take landscape photos and it still extracted portrait shots of the person in the photo, leaving out the rest of the shot"
negative,objective,It would then produce for the final photo not the shot that you intended but instead a portrait shot of the one person
negative,objective,The camera has a feature which somehow transforms a shot that you intended to be in landscape mode into a portrait shot of one person in the photo
negative,subjective,"It felt uncomfortably small in my hands, and I just didn't like the feel of the camera"
negative,subjective,"As far as the size of the camera, I think Sony overdid it making it too small"
negative,objective,"I found that with the RX100 if you panned, even at a slow pace, horizontal streaks would appear in the recorded video upon playback, which greatly detracted from the video"
negative,objective,From experience taking videos I know that you have to pan slowly if you want the audience to comfortably view a video
negative,objective,I have for comparison a much less expensive Nikon pocket camera that I bought about 3 years ago
negative,objective,My next complaint is the video
negative,objective,Within 4 days with the RX100 I looked at the viewing screen on the camera and there was a scratch across the screen
positive,objective,In the past pocket cameras have spent countless hours in my jeans pocket with no adverse consequence
positive,objective,My first comment is that I took it on a trip and kept it in my jeans pocket just like I have always done with pocket cameras
negative,subjective,You have no warranty
negative,objective,"00 camera, nobody is going to die because it is junk like in a defective automobile"
negative,objective,Would not warranty the problem
negative,objective,Had a warranty problem with Sony in 2010 on an almost new camera
negative,objective,Sony called today and said it had been wet and would not warranty the repair
negative,objective,The biggest problem is the flash would never flash( even in fill flash mode )
negative,objective,Customer support says software not Mac compatible without using some sort of workaround
negative,objective,Can't download movies from camera to Mac or Ipad
negative,objective,The problem with Sony cameras is that they don't work when you most need them
negative,objective,Now I am in hot humid Belize and it stopped working
negative,objective,"My first, a NEX 5 stopped working when travelling in Costa Rica in damp hot humid climate"
positive,subjective,Canon pro is so easy to deal with and is very responsive
negative,objective,Dealing with the service center in the Philippines is a nightmere
negative,subjective,they have a better newer model out and I would prefer to have that if I am going to pay such a high price though I am not really happy with the camera
negative,objective,lens would not retract and it froze Sony wants to replace it with the same camera which I do not want for $330+ dollars
negative,objective,It stopped working when it was 14 months old
negative,objective,For the second time I have just been gouged by Sony for $200 to repair the camera - they claimed both times I had dropped it - I hadn't
positive,subjective,Great photos - when it works
negative,subjective,Sony should redesign the camera so that you can lock in preferred settings and disable those you don't want to use
negative,objective,I wanted a portable alternative to my Canon EOS5 (which is the simplest device to use but bulky and heavy)
negative,objective,Another mis-touch caused the flash to pop up in bright sunlight
negative,objective,I discovered the mistake only when I loaded the images into my computer
negative,subjective,"I cannot imagine one person in a thousand wanting to do this, but I turned it on without realizing  and three days worth of shots were wasted"
negative,objective,&#34;Illustration&#34; allows you to turn your photographs into crude sketches
positive,objective,"Elegant casing, decent lens, crazy proliferation of settings and gimmicks, any one of which can be triggered accidentally if your hand brushes against an expositiveed control"
negative,objective,The camera had not been dropped or used in any extreme conditions
negative,objective,"Do not buy a Sony camera, 2 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired the motherboard of my DSC-RX100 camera failed"
negative,subjective,Totally not worth the price if it's only going to last a year
negative,objective,Until it stopped working one month after my warranty expired
positive,subjective,The camera is great and functions well
negative,objective,SONY WON'T HONOR THE WARRANTY saying it was abused
negative,objective,After less than a year it stopped working
negative,objective,There is no technical reason why Sony couldn't provide decent MP4 videos as well
negative,objective,"You can generate MP4 videos, but they are not quite full resolution (1440x1080 with non-square pixels that are extrapolated to 1920x1080 during playback), and you also are stuck with 30p"
negative,objective,"However, Sony insists on pushing its (and Panasonic's) stupid AVCHD format which is still not mainstream, and as a result, its videos are a pain to deal with"
positive,objective,"This camera has a decent lens and a very good sensor, so it should have the ability to take very nice videos"
positive,subjective,One of the reasons I bought this camera is to be able to take decent videos
negative,objective,The colors were still dull and lacked brilliance; and if I upped the Expositiveure they became washed out
negative,subjective,"I do not know if it was my particular camera, or this model in general, but the outdoor photos were AWFUL"
negative,objective,"Sony basically told me, ""Take your $750 camera and go SCREW YOURSELF"
negative,objective,"I mailed in my camera in ONE PIECE, they decided they won't cover it, didn't bother to put the camera back together, just shipped back the camera IN PIECES"
negative,subjective,"Worst of all, Sony Warranty sent back unserviced camera IN PIECES"
negative,objective,Sony Warranty will not cover
negative,objective,"Normal use of the setting knob with your thumb will push the frame forward, the camera will start to fall apart"
negative,subjective,&#65279;  The frame on top is not secure by any screws
negative,objective,Display models in stores appears to have same problem
negative,subjective,"The camera is  fragile, should have been more robust for what it cost"
positive,subjective,The camera has  a lot of good features
negative,subjective,I purchased a sony protection plan which turned out to be pretty much a waste of time and money
negative,subjective,Zoom is terrible
negative,subjective,"I'm also  disappointed  from Sony Service, I'l never buy anything from Sony"
negative,subjective,The RX100 series is not usable for outdoor activities
negative,objective,After 1 week in the caribien it died because of higher humidity during a tour in the mountains
negative,subjective,The repair cost would be higher than the cost of the camera
negative,objective,Back at home I sent the camera to the Sony Service and get it back not repaired 2 weeks later with the comment:  &#34;Damage caused by water&#34; and this is not included in the  guarantee
negative,objective,"SD Card not readable, please insert new"
negative,objective,With every SD Card it Shows the error message
negative,objective,"With my RX100M2 a half year old, we were in the Caribien  and after 1 week the camera could not read the SD-Card anymore"
negative,objective,"This camera is not adequate for outdoor with higher air humidity as fog, also morning fog, snow, rain, countries as Caribien,  South east asia, Florida a"
negative,objective,Sent it to Sony repair for under warranty service
negative,objective,Dead battery and would not charge or turn on
negative,objective,In just two months it simply died despite careful handling and use
negative,objective,The problems appear with the build quality
positive,objective,Also it records good video at 1080p and had no problem editing it
positive,subjective,Its really useful to be able to tilt up the flash and bounce it against the ceiling to achieve difuse flash light
negative,subjective,WHAT GOOD IS A CAMERA IF THE COMPANY DOESN'T STAND BEHIND IT
negative,objective,After a month of haggling the best Sony will do is replace the camera for $279
negative,objective,Sony says it was damaged and voided the warranty
negative,objective,It was sent in under warranty
negative,objective,PLEASE READ - This camera stopped working 8 months after purchase
negative,subjective,I really wanted this to work out
negative,subjective,"I hope Sony improves the firmware to fix many of the software issues, if not redesign the physical issues as well"
negative,objective,"Wifi worked when it wanted to, again it dropped connection to my cell phone during a tranfer"
negative,subjective,The menu system is truly hard to navigate and configure
negative,objective,"The top dials were too stiff, needing more than 2 fingers to move"
negative,objective,More over the screw mount was positioned so you can not have it mounted and use the HDMI port or access the memory / batteries
negative,subjective,It is very very slow even outdoor
negative,subjective,"This camera, or the piece I received, is completely s***"
negative,objective,It was not available for delivery when I ordered this camera
negative,objective,Cannot see a thing on the screen when shooting in high light situations and had to use a loupe by Hoodman to see anything
negative,objective,Slow shutter response no matter what settings I use or a high speed card in it (I know how to use all the settings)
negative,objective,Bottom battery cover keeps flipping open constantly
negative,subjective,The instructions were worthless
negative,objective,The camera guide offered three other methods to download pictures but nothing worked
negative,objective,It continuously goes in and out of focus
negative,objective,"10 days into a three week European vacation, the motor that runs the focus sticks"
negative,objective,"And when I then turn it off, the screen goes dark but the lens does not retract"
negative,objective,"When I turn it on, some information appears on the screen but no image; and the lens extends"
negative,objective,UPDATE 2: After working for one day it failed again and the failure seems to be final
negative,subjective,"Even if it hadn't failed, I would still be very dissatisfied because the display is extremely difficult to see in bright sunlight"
negative,objective,"So we returned it and got a replacement, same camera which worked longer, but them the flash failed"
negative,objective,"Ok, the first failure of this model happened while we were vacationing in Europe and that was annoying, camera stopped talking to SD cards, tried different cards same result"
negative,subjective,Paid more for what I thought was a quality Sony and both were junk
negative,subjective,"As I needed another ASAP, I was forced to buy a second camera, which had the exact error message right out of the box"
negative,objective,Bought it new and eventually got it set-up okay as there was no manual either included or online
negative,subjective,Shame on you Sony for taking people's money and providing an inferior product
negative,objective,"My in-laws had a similar problem with the Sony camera, which was less than 1 year old and Sony refused to repair it"
negative,objective,"So Sony is well aware of this problem, and continues to tell me that I have to repair it at my cost"
negative,subjective,Despite being in contact with management no one at this company is willing to stand by their product
negative,objective,"When I contacted Sony, they refused to repair the problem"
negative,objective,At the beginning of Dec we noticed the flash would not work
negative,subjective,"It may work ok for a little while,  but less than a year is not a good product"
negative,objective,Sony is refusing to fix it
negative,objective,The flash is now broken and none of the troubleshooting fixed the problem
negative,objective,Therefor  I can only take 2 photos with its internal memory
negative,objective,It will not accept any SD card that I put in it
negative,objective,"You can't manually make the lens come in and out and open so when something electronic goes in it, the camera is useless"
negative,subjective,Thought maybe it was the battery being low but it was not
negative,objective,"Used this only a few times, and had a problem with the lens coming in and out"
negative,objective,I now have no decent photos's of my son's college graduation and Christmas
negative,subjective,The rest are blurry
negative,subjective,"Of the 200 pics I took with this camera 6 are usable, and even those aren't very good"
negative,objective,One in every ten pictures comes out decent
negative,objective,Tried to adjust white balance and exposure settings on the camera and nothing works
negative,objective,It takes over exposed blurry pictures and the video comes out all pixelated
negative,objective,Can't focus when shooting close up shots
negative,subjective,Don't waste your $$
negative,subjective,This takes horrible pictures/video
negative,objective,No instructions on how to do it
negative,objective,Photos would not download to my computer
negative,subjective,"Six of ten pictures taken were blurry, poor image quality in general"
negative,objective,First time (for my particular case) the number one item for this category in Amazon  did not accomplish what the majority of reviews indicated
negative,subjective,- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
negative,subjective,. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
negative,subjective,. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
negative,subjective,. lens cap is a really annoying
negative,subjective,. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
negative,subjective,. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
negative,subjective,"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )"
negative,subjective,1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
negative,subjective,1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
negative,subjective,"1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet ."
negative,subjective,2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
negative,subjective,2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
negative,subjective,2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
negative,subjective,2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
negative,subjective,"2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured ."
negative,subjective,2) Phone is awfully slow.
negative,subjective,2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
negative,subjective,3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
negative,subjective,"3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias ."
negative,subjective,"3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust ."
negative,subjective,"3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card"
negative,subjective,"4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the ""other than phone"" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done ."
negative,subjective,4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
negative,subjective,"5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the ""Free picture and video messaging"" offered by service provider."
negative,subjective,"8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything."
negative,subjective,A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
negative,subjective,about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
negative,subjective,"After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem."
negative,subjective,"after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !"
negative,subjective,"after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent ."
negative,subjective,All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
negative,subjective,"All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera."
negative,subjective,All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
negative,subjective,"also , the lens cap design is flawed ."
negative,subjective,"also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works ."
negative,subjective,Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.
negative,subjective,Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
negative,subjective,"Also, when I dial an ""800"" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu."
negative,subjective,"although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing ."
negative,subjective,"Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall."
negative,subjective,Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
negative,subjective,and the battery life is bad !
negative,subjective,"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 ."
negative,subjective,Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
negative,subjective,"Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants."
negative,subjective,"apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands ."
negative,subjective,"As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on."
negative,subjective,audio on video also lacking .
negative,subjective,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage ."
negative,subjective,"Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average ."
negative,subjective,battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
negative,subjective,buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
negative,subjective,Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
negative,subjective,"Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up."
negative,subjective,"finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier ."
negative,subjective,"Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me."
negative,subjective,"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost ."
negative,subjective,"focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange ."
negative,subjective,games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
negative,subjective,got way too many blurry pictures .
negative,subjective,"Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate."
negative,subjective,"however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line ."
negative,subjective,"however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality ."
negative,subjective,I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
negative,subjective,"I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel."
negative,subjective,i am bored with the silver look .
negative,subjective,"i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous ."
negative,subjective,"I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse."
negative,subjective,I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
negative,subjective,"i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough ."
negative,subjective,I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
negative,subjective,i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
negative,subjective,i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
negative,subjective,"I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while."
negative,subjective,I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
negative,subjective,"I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application."
negative,subjective,"i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included ."
negative,subjective,I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
negative,subjective,"I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract."
negative,subjective,I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
negative,subjective,"i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable ."
negative,subjective,I then realized a major design flaw.
negative,subjective,"I thought given all the ""10"" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey."
negative,subjective,I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
negative,subjective,I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
negative,subjective,I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
negative,subjective,I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
negative,subjective,I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
negative,subjective,If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
negative,subjective,"If you're looking for a new company, don't be fooled by the service plans."
negative,subjective,in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
negative,subjective,"In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece."
negative,subjective,"In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly."
negative,subjective,"it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) ."
negative,subjective,it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
negative,subjective,"it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot ."
negative,subjective,it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
negative,subjective,"it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service ."
negative,subjective,It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
negative,subjective,it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
negative,subjective,"It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it."
negative,subjective,it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
negative,subjective,It would not hang up on calls.
negative,subjective,It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
negative,subjective,"It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow."
negative,subjective,It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
negative,subjective,Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
negative,subjective,"I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!"
negative,subjective,Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
negative,subjective,"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing ."
negative,subjective,"My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long."
negative,subjective,My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
negative,subjective,my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
negative,subjective,"negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button ."
negative,subjective,"Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage."
negative,subjective,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !"
negative,subjective,"on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm ."
negative,subjective,On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
negative,subjective,"On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative."
negative,subjective,"Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery."
negative,subjective,"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough ."
negative,subjective,one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
negative,subjective,"one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 ."
negative,subjective,one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
negative,subjective,"one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia ."
negative,subjective,"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all ."
negative,subjective,"one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible ."
negative,subjective,"one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work ."
negative,subjective,Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
negative,subjective,"only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing ."
negative,subjective,"Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth."
negative,subjective,"OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface."
negative,subjective,Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
negative,subjective,"Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,"
negative,subjective,other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
negative,subjective,pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
negative,subjective,poor visibility on the keys .
negative,subjective,regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
negative,subjective,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots ."
negative,subjective,"ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring ."
negative,subjective,"Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go."
negative,subjective,"since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" ."
negative,subjective,"so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option ."
negative,subjective,Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
negative,subjective,Some more manual control would have been nice.
negative,subjective,"some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to ."
negative,subjective,"Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name ""the bar of soap"" which, it really is."
negative,subjective,"Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 ""adjust levels"" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though."
negative,subjective,"Sometimes, various applications crash."
negative,subjective,Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
negative,subjective,"STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing."
negative,subjective,Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
negative,subjective,The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
negative,subjective,the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
negative,subjective,The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
negative,subjective,The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
negative,subjective,The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
negative,subjective,"the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --"
negative,subjective,The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
negative,subjective,The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
negative,subjective,The buttons are rather stiff.
negative,subjective,"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots ."
negative,subjective,the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
negative,subjective,"The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark."
negative,subjective,The digital zoom is crap.
negative,subjective,"The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can."
negative,subjective,The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
negative,subjective,"the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead ."
negative,subjective,The flash is very weak.
negative,subjective,the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
negative,subjective,the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
negative,subjective,the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
negative,subjective,"the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective ."
negative,subjective,"the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network ."
negative,subjective,"the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press ."
negative,subjective,"the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird ."
negative,subjective,The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
negative,subjective,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me ."
negative,subjective,"the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) ."
negative,subjective,The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
negative,subjective,The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
negative,subjective,"The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well."
negative,subjective,the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
negative,subjective,The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
negative,subjective,The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
negative,subjective,"The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone."
negative,subjective,the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
negative,subjective,"the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr ."
negative,subjective,The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
negative,subjective,The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
negative,subjective,"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots ."
negative,subjective,the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
negative,subjective,The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
negative,subjective,The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
negative,subjective,The only problem is the size of the keys.
negative,subjective,the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
negative,subjective,"the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!"
negative,subjective,The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
negative,subjective,the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
negative,subjective,the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
negative,subjective,"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera ."
negative,subjective,"the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!"
negative,subjective,"the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do ."
negative,subjective,The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
negative,subjective,The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
negative,subjective,"The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion."
negative,subjective,"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )"
negative,subjective,the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
negative,subjective,"The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice."
negative,subjective,the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
negative,subjective,the vibrate setting is loud !
negative,subjective,the vibration is not top .
negative,subjective,"The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17."
negative,subjective,The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
negative,subjective,"the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call ."
negative,subjective,the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
negative,subjective,The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
negative,subjective,the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
negative,subjective,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy ."
negative,subjective,"their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience ."
negative,subjective,They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
negative,subjective,They really are awfully small.
negative,subjective,this camera has a major design flaw .
negative,subjective,"this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it ."
negative,subjective,This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
negative,subjective,"This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)"
negative,subjective,"This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine."
negative,subjective,"this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands ."
negative,subjective,"This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer)."
negative,subjective,This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
negative,subjective,"This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free."
negative,subjective,T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
negative,subjective,"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder ."
negative,subjective,"To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem."
negative,subjective,"unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming ."
negative,subjective,Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
negative,subjective,we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
negative,subjective,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise ."
negative,subjective,"When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless."
negative,subjective,"When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin."
negative,subjective,when talking the voice is not very clear .
negative,subjective,"When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !"
negative,subjective,"When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow."
negative,subjective,"When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct."
negative,subjective,who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
negative,subjective,"within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob ."
negative,subjective,"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture ."
negative,subjective,you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
negative,subjective,You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
positive,subjective,":! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool."
positive,subjective,"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings ."
positive,subjective,1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
positive,subjective,10 great price for all the features .
positive,subjective,"2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception."
positive,subjective,3 ) 4x zoom is nice
positive,subjective,3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
positive,subjective,3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
positive,subjective,3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
positive,subjective,3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
positive,subjective,"4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking ."
positive,subjective,4- Looks great.
positive,subjective,4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
positive,subjective,"4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price ."
positive,subjective,4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
positive,subjective,4. The Build is just right.
positive,subjective,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )"
positive,subjective,5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
positive,subjective,"5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables."
positive,subjective,5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
positive,subjective,6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
positive,subjective,6600 looks and feels nice.
positive,subjective,7- 360\u001a panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
positive,subjective,7 picture quality is excellent .
positive,subjective,7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
positive,subjective,"8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets ."
positive,subjective,8 battery life is excellent .
positive,subjective,"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )"
positive,subjective,"A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with."
positive,subjective,"A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition."
positive,subjective,a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
positive,subjective,A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
positive,subjective,A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
positive,subjective,"additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )"
positive,subjective,advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
positive,subjective,"after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel ."
positive,subjective,"After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures."
positive,subjective,after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
positive,subjective,"after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket ."
positive,subjective,"All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time."
positive,subjective,"Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features."
positive,subjective,"also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage ."
positive,subjective,"Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast."
positive,subjective,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon ."
positive,subjective,"Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go."
positive,subjective,"although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone ."
positive,subjective,"Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support."
positive,subjective,"And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge."
positive,subjective,And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30.
positive,subjective,And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.
positive,subjective,And the video quality is amazing.
positive,subjective,another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
positive,subjective,Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
positive,subjective,another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
positive,subjective,another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
positive,subjective,APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
positive,subjective,As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
positive,subjective,"As for bluetooth, no problems at all."
positive,subjective,As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
positive,subjective,"As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt."
positive,subjective,"At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph."
positive,subjective,autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
positive,subjective,awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
positive,subjective,"battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves ."
positive,subjective,"battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have ."
positive,subjective,battery life is good for a phone of this size .
positive,subjective,"battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so ."
positive,subjective,because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
positive,subjective,because this camera is beautiful .
positive,subjective,Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
positive,subjective,"best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything ."
positive,subjective,"big lcd screen - at least for me, 2"" is enough"
positive,subjective,"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices ."
positive,subjective,"but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. ."
positive,subjective,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !"
positive,subjective,"But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100."
positive,subjective,"But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue."
positive,subjective,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !"
positive,subjective,But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
positive,subjective,but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
positive,subjective,But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
positive,subjective,"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced ."
positive,subjective,"Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds."
positive,subjective,Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
positive,subjective,canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
positive,subjective,canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
positive,subjective,Capacity is not a problem here.
positive,subjective,color screen is good .
positive,subjective,"comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small ."
positive,subjective,"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon ."
positive,subjective,controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
positive,subjective,"Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight."
positive,subjective,DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
positive,subjective,"despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography ."
positive,subjective,"digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture"
positive,subjective,Download it fast to your computer
positive,subjective,Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).
positive,subjective,Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
positive,subjective,"even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio ."
positive,subjective,"excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures ."
positive,subjective,"Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste)."
positive,subjective,"first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's ."
positive,subjective,first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
positive,subjective,"first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint ."
positive,subjective,"First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc."
positive,subjective,"First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software."
positive,subjective,Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
positive,subjective,"For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well."
positive,subjective,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 ."
positive,subjective,"from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone ."
positive,subjective,"FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD"
positive,subjective,Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
positive,subjective,Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
positive,subjective,"great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like ."
positive,subjective,"great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it ."
positive,subjective,"great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc."
positive,subjective,"great colors , pictures and white balance ."
positive,subjective,"great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !"
positive,subjective,"great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great."
positive,subjective,"Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others)."
positive,subjective,great screen and great sound .
positive,subjective,great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
positive,subjective,"Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality."
positive,subjective,"Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting."
positive,subjective,Have a great and easy to use bundled software
positive,subjective,Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
positive,subjective,"having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos ."
positive,subjective,"here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy ."
positive,subjective,"however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off ."
positive,subjective,"I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest."
positive,subjective,I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
positive,subjective,i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
positive,subjective,"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits ."
positive,subjective,i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
positive,subjective,i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
positive,subjective,"I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money."
positive,subjective,"I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine."
positive,subjective,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images ."
positive,subjective,I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
positive,subjective,"i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)"
positive,subjective,i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
positive,subjective,i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
positive,subjective,"i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email ."
positive,subjective,"I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down."
positive,subjective,I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
positive,subjective,i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
positive,subjective,"I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic)."
positive,subjective,"I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality."
positive,subjective,"i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive ."
positive,subjective,"i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power ."
positive,subjective,"I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life."
positive,subjective,"I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well)."
positive,subjective,i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
positive,subjective,I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
positive,subjective,"I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face."
positive,subjective,i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
positive,subjective,I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
positive,subjective,"I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size."
positive,subjective,"I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card)."
positive,subjective,"i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route ."
positive,subjective,"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it ."
positive,subjective,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased ."
positive,subjective,I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
positive,subjective,"I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great."

negative,objective,the included memory card is too small .
negative,objective,The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.

negative,objective,This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
negative,objective,"Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices."
negative,objective,what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
negative,objective,"when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :"
negative,objective,when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
negative,objective,"while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets ."
negative,objective,you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
negative,objective,You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
